= Analyze Container Resources

The idea of these scripts is simple. Record and collect the information of a single container and afterwards analyze the recorded information. 

The objective is to better understand how much resources SecHub or a PDS-Solution use or any other container. The focus of these scripts is to profile the container temporarly and not to monitor them long term.

The folder contains two scripts:

. to record container resources
. to analyze and visualize the resources

== Record Resource Usage

+
----
Usage: basename ./record-resources.sh <container-id> <result-file>
----
+
For example:

----

== Analyze & Visualize

+
----

----

. Analyze a recorded file:
