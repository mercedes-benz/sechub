# Pages

Vue components created in this folder will automatically be converted to navigatable routes.

Full documentation for this feature can be found in the Official [unplugin-vue-router](https://github.com/posva/unplugin-vue-router) repository.

Please note: since the project overview is our landing page, it is the component in the index.vue.
For every new page, create a vue file here.
