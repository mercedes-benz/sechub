 * SecHub has a very generic data model for statistic data. Often it is very

 * This keep data structure clear and make it easier to collect them by SQL
 * queries. Also it is always clear inside code which type can contain which
 * keys. But sometimes it is necessary to accept any key - e.g. when the key
 * represents a scanned language and we may not constrain this to explicit
 * values. So we need a way to define this as well and it must be still clear
 * inside code, that in this situation there is no restriction and that every
 * text is accepted as key.<br>
 * <br>
 * To provide types which accept any text as key, just define them with
 * referencing {@link #ANY_TEXT}.
