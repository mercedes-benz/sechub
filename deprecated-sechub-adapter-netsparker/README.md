About this project
==================
ATTENTION: The netsparker product support is deprecated and will be removed in future!

This an adapter project to access product NETSPARKER.
It has no dependency to any sechub part and can be used as a single command line program too (for test purpose).

A product executor can use this adapter to access the product.
The adapter itself is pretty dumb and does only now the product stuff...
