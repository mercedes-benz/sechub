= SecHub Solution

This folder contains the scripts to run SecHub in a container.

== Local Container

=== Single Container

To start a single container run the script:

----
./01-start-single-docker-compose.sh
----

=== SecHub with PDS Solution

. First start a SecHub container.

. Most of the PDS Solutions have a script which starts with `05-*`. Execute this script next.

. Run one of the PDS setup scripts. For example: `setup-pds/8000-setup-gosec.sh` to setup a GoSec project.

. Use the SecHub Client to scan.
