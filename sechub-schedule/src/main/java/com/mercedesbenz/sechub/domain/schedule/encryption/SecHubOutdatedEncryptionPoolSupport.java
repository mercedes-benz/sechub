     * This method is used to avoid the risk of race conditions when encryption pool
     * entries are still in use but wanted to be removed.
     * <h3>Example-Situation:</h3>
     *
     * <pre>
     * SecHub-Cluster member A: - SECRET_1 - SECRET_2 (new encryption pool entry PA, poolId = 2)
     *
     * SecHub-Cluster member B: - SECRET_1 (old encryption pool entry PB, poolId = 1)
     * </pre>
     *
     * SecHub B creates now a new job which is currently not stored in database but
     * with old encryption pool PB (poolId=1). In the mean time cluster member A
     * does not find any jobs which using pool id 1 and could delete now the
     * encryption pool entity with id 1...<br>
     * <br>
     * After this the member B would write the encrypted configuration with poolId=1
     * to database, because the encryption pool is still in memory and its latest
     * entry is pool id 1 -> after this member 2 is also new started with only
     * SECRET_2 settings..
     *
     * --> Now we have a bad situation: we would have a created job encrypted with
     * SECRET_1, but no possibility to handle the created job by SecHub any more.
     *
     *
     * <h3>Problem</h3>
     *
     * SecHub does not use a full blown event bus (like KAFKA) but a simple event
     * listener approach which works only inside one JVM, we have no possibility to
     * send cluster wide events to check there are no longer outdated encryption
     * pools used.
     *
     * <h3>Solution</h3> To handle the problem without a full blown event bus, we
     * ensure that outdated encryption pools can remain running only a dedicated
     * time. The time an outdated encryption pool is accepted is calculated by
     * {@link #isOutdatedEncryptionStillAllowedOnThisClusterMember()}.
     *
     * Means we ask here the question: "Was the maximum outdate time exceeded at the
     * last refresh interval?"
