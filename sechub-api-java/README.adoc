== About SecHub Java API

This project was established to have an easy to use SecHub API Java library.

=== Usage

Just create an instance of `com.mercedesbenz.sechub.api.SecHubClient` and use the client methods.

For a working example please look into `sechub-examples/example-sechub-api-java`.

=== Build and development

The aim of the API was to

- have an easy to use library which can be used in SecHub plugins (Eclipse, IntelliJ),
  our WebUI and also by customers which want to use a java library instead of the
  command line client (`sechub-cli`) 
- have less effort when it comes to changes
- detect OpenAPI file generation problems
- as far as possible use code generation
- provide a stable API

==== Generation and build lifecycle handling
We use OpenAPI generator gradle plugin to generate the API with our existing `openApi3.json`.
Because the file is generated from `sechub-doc` at build time we have a lifecycle problem here.

To solve this, `sechub-api-java` is only build in some "sechub build stages" - which can be
defined with `-Dsechub.build.stage=$stage`.

But there were some issues with the generated java files and also with some logic of the REST 
communication. To have a stable client library and still be possible to switch/update generators or
underlying network libraries a wrapper facade mechanism was introduced.


==== OpenAPI generated
Those parts are automatically generated in our builds. But if you want to do this from command
line just call `./generateOpenAPIClassFiles.sh` and the files will be generated again.

==== Public API model
All public API model classes are in same package like `SecHubClient`: `com.mercedesbenz.sechub.api`.

The public parts do internally use the generated OpenAPI parts or shall be able to handle special
situations.
 
They represent a stability layer: The methods provided by this class shall not change - additional
methods are "new features", but removing existing public methods must be handled as breaking 
changes!

===== Internal API wrapper model
The internal API wrapper model classes are abstract classes which are inherited by the public model
parts. The abstract classes provide access to the OpenAPI generated classes, but still hide
them - except for child classes. 

It is not intended to change the internal classes (or use it from outside). Only the public model 
classes shall be used or changed manually.

===== Generation
To avoid coding the wrapper parts manually a generator was introduced - but this generator is 
NOT called at build time automatically! This must be done by a developer and the changed sources
must be commited to git !
  

Inside your IDE open the `ApiWrapperObjectsGeneratorManualTest` and run it with `-Dsechub.generate=true`.
It will generate and also format the sources. After generation check for deltas.

Because the public models can be customized, these files are generated only when not existing. If
you want to overwrite existing parts you can set `-Dsechub.generate.overwrite=true`. But be
aware that you have to add all former custom changes in this case!
