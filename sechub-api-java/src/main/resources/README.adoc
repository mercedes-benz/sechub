:reduced-filename: reduced-openapi3.json
 
The file `{reduced-filename}` inside this folder is a reduced variant of `openapi3.json` which is
generated by `sechub-doc` gradle sub module at build time.

The difference to the origin file is, that this file is reproducible: it contains no (changing) 
examples and it is inside git, means available after a fresh git clone.

[NOTE]
====
Main purpose for this file is to have the possibility to import the SecHub project into an IDE 
without any compile errors.
`sechub-api-java` has a gen folder which contains classes generated by OpenAPI generator.
The generator uses `{reduced-filename}` to generate the classes.
