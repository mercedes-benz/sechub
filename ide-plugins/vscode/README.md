# SecHub VSCode/VSCodium/Eclipse Theia plugin

This is an VSCode/VSCodium/Eclipse Theia plugin for a convenient IDE integration of [SecHub](https://github.com/mercedes-benz/sechub).

## Features

* Read and navigate through SecHub reports
* Supported modules: `codeScan` and `secretScan`

## Installation

Recommended: Install the plugin from the Open-VSX marketplace from within [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) or [Eclipse Theia](https://theia-ide.org/) by searching for the term: `sechub` in the `Extensions` manager.

For VS Code you need to download the [plugin](https://open-vsx.org/extension/mercedes-benz/sechub) and install it manually. It is also possible to install the plugin manually in VSCodium and Eclipse Theia.

NOTE: Please use the new plugin from Mercedes-Benz: https://open-vsx.org/extension/mercedes-benz/sechub. The old Daimler plugin will be deprecated. The reason for the deprecation is the rebranding of Daimler to Mercedes-Benz.
