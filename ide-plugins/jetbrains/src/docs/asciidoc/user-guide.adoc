== About

This is an IntelliJ plugin for a convenient IDE integration of https://github.com/mercedes-benz/sechub[SecHub]

The project website can be found at https://github.com/mercedes-benz/sechub-plugin-intellij[SecHub Plugin IntelliJ]
Marketplace entry available at https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23379-sechub[IntelliJ Plugin Page]

== Features

Here you will find all implemented features of the plugin. Planned features and ideas can be found at
https://github.com/mercedes-benz/sechub-plugin-intellij/issues[GitHub issue tracker].

=== Connect to the SecHub Server

You can connect to a SecHub server by using the `Server` tab. It allows you to enter the URL of the SecHub server
and the API token to authenticate against the SecHub server. Once connected, you can use the plugin to interact with the SecHub server,
such as loading projects and jobs. The `Server` tab also provides a link to the Web UI.

=== Select a project

You can select a project by using the `Project` dropdown in the `Server` tab. It allows you to select a project from the SecHub server and
list its jobs. Note that you'll only see projects that you have access to. If you don't see any projects, speak to your
administrator.

=== List jobs of a project

Once you have selected a project, the plugin will list all jobs of that project in the `Jobs` table.
Each job will show its ID, state, result, creation date and by whom it was executed. You can double-click
a job which is in `ENDED` state to open the SecHub report in the `Report` tab.

=== Import an existing SecHub report

You can either import an existing `SecHub` report file by using the import action at `Tools->Import SecHub report` or
by dragging a report file from the file explorer into the report table (marked as [.small]#1.# in figure [.small]#1# ).

TIP: Since V0.4.0 the UI has been improved/changed a bit, but functionality is still as described

=== Use call hierarchy view to traverse finding steps
Double-click on an entry inside the report table (marked as [.small]#1.# in figure [.small]#1# ).

When you have done this, you will see the complete call hierarchy from entrypoint to data sink inside call hierarchy
tree marked as [.small]#2.# in overview picture.

Selecting an entry inside the call hierarchy will show the reported source code
(marked as [.small]#3.# in figure [.small]#1#) with details about its location
and open the editor, highlighting the reported line.

If you have already changed your code and the report location does no longer match 100% to the finding location, the
editor will still mark reported location - in this case please look at the origin reported source code and search for
the origin part. If the file cannot be found by plugin, no editor will be opened.

=== Mark a finding as false positive

You can mark a finding as false positive by checking the `False Positive` checkbox in the report table.
Findings that have been marked as false positive before will show a blue checkmark. They can not be interacted with anymore.
False positive markings are cached by default locally until they are successfully sent to the SecHub server.
