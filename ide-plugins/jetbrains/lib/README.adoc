== Libraries
==== `sechub-java-api-all-0.0.0`
Is a fat jar which is build inside SecHub (https://github.com/mercedesbenz/sechub) rootfolder with
```bash
./gradlew buildJavaApiAll -Dsechub.build.stage=all
```

At the moment SecHub libraries are not available via a maven
repository (e.g. maven central). When the libraries become available,
we will get rid off the binaries inside the git repository and will
use not use the fat jar but the dedicated libraries.

But in the mean time...
[IMPORTANT]
.Classes to remove
====
After the SecHub build has been done, it is necessary to remove the
slf4j parts manually from the fat jar to get it working inside IntelliJ!
Otherwise there are runtime problems with the existing slf4j classes inside IntelliJ!

This is just a workaround.
