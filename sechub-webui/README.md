# SecHub WebUI

## Overview

SecHub WebUI is a web-based user interface for managing and interacting with the SecHub application. This document provides instructions for setting up and running the application locally.

## Profiles

To start the application locally use the `webui_local` profile.

This will include the following profiles:

- `webui_localserver`
- `webui_mocked` (only if you don't want to talk to the actual SecHub server)

This will enable configurations suitable for local development and testing.
