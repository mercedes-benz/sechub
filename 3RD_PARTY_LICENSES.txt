SOFTWARE RIGHTS

ANTLR 1989-2004 Developed by Terence Parr Partially supported by University of
San Francisco & jGuru.com

We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the public domain. An
individual or company may do whatever they wish with source code distributed with
ANTLR or the code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of ANTLR, or
its output, into commerical software.

We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, we do ask that credit
is given to us for developing ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR
or incorporate any source code into one of your programs (commercial product,
research project, or otherwise) that you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the
documentation, research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have developed a
nice tool with the output, please mention that you developed it using ANTLR. In
addition, we ask that the headers remain intact in our source code. As long as
these guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this system and expect
to make other tools available as they are completed.

    sublicense and distribute the Original Software (or portions thereof), with
    or without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

    Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and (2) the
    combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
    Version (or portions of such combination).

    (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the
    date Contributor first distributes or otherwise makes the Modifications

    (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted:

      (1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version;

      (2) for infringements caused by: (i) third party modifications of
      Contributor Version, or (ii) the combination of Modifications made by that
      Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version)
      or other devices; or

      (3) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
      Modifications made by that Contributor.


  3. Distribution Obligations.

    3.1. Availability of Source Code.

    Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in
    Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that
    Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License.
    You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code
    form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You
    must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to
    how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable
    manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

    3.2. Modifications.

    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by
    the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications
    are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the
    rights conveyed by this License.

    3.3. Required Notices.

    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You
    as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any
    copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software,
    or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any
    Contributor or the Initial Developer.

    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code
    form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
    recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee
    for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
    recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own
    behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
    must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
    liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
    indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
    incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
    warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the
    terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which
    may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
    compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
    Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in
    the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You
    distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license,
    You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this
    License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
    Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
    Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
    Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

    3.6. Larger Works.

    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code
    not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a
    single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
    License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.


  4. Versions of the License.

    4.1. New Versions.

    Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new
    versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a
    distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one
    other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.

    4.2. Effect of New Versions.

    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
    Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which
    You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer
    includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being
    distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the
    License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under
    the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received
    the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
    otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
    subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

    4.3. Modified Versions.

    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for
    Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this
    License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name
    of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this
    License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms
    which differ from this License.


  5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

  COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT
  WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
  LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
  MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK
  AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD
  ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL
  DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
  REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART
  OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT
  UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.



  6. TERMINATION.

    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such
    breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by
    their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
    shall survive.

    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
    judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
    Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as
    “Participant”) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the
    Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original
    Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or
    indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
    indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial
    Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1
    and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant
    terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day
    notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim
    with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either
    unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

    6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
    that the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent
    where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the
    initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of
    the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be
    taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
    license.

    6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end
    user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor
    hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any
    distributor) shall survive termination.


  7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
  NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
  OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF
  ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
  INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
  LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
  MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
  PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
  INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
  PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
  LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
  LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.



  8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

  The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48
  C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” (as that
  term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer
  software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
  1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through
  227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software
  with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is
  in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision
  that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.



  9. MISCELLANEOUS.

  This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
  hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
  provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
  enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction
  specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the
  extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
  jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
  License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the
  jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original
  Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
  limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
  application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
  Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that
  the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
  apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance
  with the United States export administration regulations (and the export
  control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or
  otherwise make available any Covered Software.



  10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

  As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
  for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization
  of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and
  Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
  herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.



  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE
  (CDDL)

  The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of
  California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to
  this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
  Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of
  California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.

SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT
RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS.
CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE
INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES
RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
HEREUNDER.


Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship
and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to
the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of
creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater
distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work
(the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected
by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights").
Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
    and translate a Work;

  ii.  moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
    depicted in a Work;

  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject
    to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a
    Work;

  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
    European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
    protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
    including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
    based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or
unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
the Work

  i.  in all territories worldwide,

  ii.  for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including
    future time extensions),

  iii.  in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and

  iv.  for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
    advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver").

Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large
and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that
such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express
Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall
be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged
Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable,
non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to
exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work

  i.  in all territories worldwide,

  ii.  for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including
    future time extensions),

  iii.  in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and

  iv.  for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
    advertising or promotional purposes (the "License").

The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer
to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such
case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not

  i.  exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the
    Work or

  ii.  assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the
    Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of
    any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
    including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
    for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other
    defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
    discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that
    may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any
    person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
    disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or
    other rights required for any use of the Work.

  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party
    to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or
    use of the Work.

Eclipse Public License - v 1.0
==============================

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including
all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce,
prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and
sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative
works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor
that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient
for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and
licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to
secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a
third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright
rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in
this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages,
including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such
as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,
and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.
The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to
any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and
cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related
settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial
Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial
Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to
those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes
such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section
2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply
with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure
such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such
noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and
any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation
may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed
subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to
distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.
Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no
rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights
in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after
the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any
resulting litigation.

  Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
  reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
  Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and
  such Derivative Works.
  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
  Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
  Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
  transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other
  form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution
  and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
  such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
  which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
  its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
  Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
  property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability
  to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
  intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
  responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
  For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
  Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that
  license before distributing the Program.
  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
  copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license
  set forth in this Agreement.
  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes
  additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this
  Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the
  terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).


3. REQUIREMENTS
---------------

3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with
  section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement
  that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and
  informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
  medium customarily used for software exchange; and
  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than
  this Agreement, provided that such license:

    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties
    and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of
    title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
    merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability
    for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
    consequential damages, such as lost profits;

3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program

    (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made
    available under a Secondary License, and
    (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described
    in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under
    the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and

  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark,
attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability
(‘notices’) contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they
Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.


4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
--------------------------

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor (“Commercial Contributor”) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively “Losses”) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.
The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to
any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and
cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related
settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial
Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial
Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to
those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
those damages.


5. NO WARRANTY
--------------

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES
OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the
Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this
Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.


6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
--------------------------

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY
FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY
THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE
PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.


7. GENERAL
----------

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes
such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section
2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply
with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure
such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such
noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and
any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation
may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed
subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to
Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.

Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no
rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights
in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing
in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a
Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under
this Agreement.


Exhibit A – Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
---------------------------------------------

“This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary
Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse
Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and
exceptions or additional permissions here}.”

  Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not
  sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file,
  then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a
  relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a
  notice.

  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Version 2, June 1991

59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most
of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors
commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your
programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer
you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish
to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free
use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or
work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without
limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not
restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;
keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at
your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
these conditions:

      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
      that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
      in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
      licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
      this License.

      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
      you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
      most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
      appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
      else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
      the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
      of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
      not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is
      not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,
and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights
to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to
control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section
2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
provided that you also do one of the following:

      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
      code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
      on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
      give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
      performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
      corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
      and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
      distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for
      noncommercial distribution

and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the
source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not
include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code
from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third
parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept
this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program
or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the
recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,
distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may
not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties
to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on
you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those
who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the
section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is
up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software
through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical
distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this
License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a
version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you
have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program
does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all
derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
software generally.

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED
IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which
everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of
warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer
to where the full notice is found.

      one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.

      Copyright (C)

      This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
      under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
      Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)
      any later version.

      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
      ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
      FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for
      more details.

      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
      with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59
      Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
starts in an interactive mode:

      Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes
      with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free
      software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;
      type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts
of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called
something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or
menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a
sample; alter the names:

      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest

      in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers)

      written by James Hacker.

      signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989

      Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider
it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If
this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead
of this License.

Classpath is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License with
the following clarification and special exception.

Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU
General Public License cover the whole combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you permission
to link this library with independent modules to produce an executable,
regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and
distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you
also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the
license of that module. An independent module is a module which is not derived
from or based on this library. If you modify this library, you may extend this
exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to do so. If
you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.

As such, it can be used to run, create and distribute a large class of
applications and applets. When GNU Classpath is used unmodified as the core class
library for a virtual machine, compiler for the java languge, or for a program
written in the java programming language it does not affect the licensing for
distributing those programs directly.

      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

      [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts

      as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence

      the version number 2.1.]


Preamble
--------

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we
suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,
based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish);
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change
the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed
that you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code
with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so
that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library
and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and
(2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no
warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else
and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original
version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by
problems that might be introduced by others.

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free
program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the
users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.
Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the
library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this
license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,
applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary
General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to
permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a
derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore
permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.
The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other
code with the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to
protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also
provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing
non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General
Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides
advantages in certain special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard.
To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more
frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free
libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to
free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For
example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many
more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the
GNU/Linux operating system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the
Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified
version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived
from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order
to run.


TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
---------------------------------------------------------------

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying
it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also
called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as
to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those
functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been
distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the
Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the
Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its
contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the
Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the
Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer
of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at
your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
these conditions:

      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
      that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all
      third parties under the terms of this License.

      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of
      data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other
      than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make
      a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not
      supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs
      whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose
      that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,
      Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used
      by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it,
      the square root function must still compute square roots.)

      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
      sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be
      reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
      this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
      distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
      sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
      distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
      permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
      each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
      rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
      the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
      based on the Library.

      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with
      the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage
      or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of
      this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must
alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the
ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a
newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has
appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any
other change in these notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so
the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and
derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into
a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even
though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object
code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is
designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called
a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative
work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an
executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of
the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is
therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of
such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part
of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the
Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially
significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is
itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by
law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and
accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in
length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether
it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus
portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing
that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with
the Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work
that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of
the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that
the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must
supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright
notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as
well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you
must do one of these things:

      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
      source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the
      work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the
      work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
      machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source
      code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a
      modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that
      the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will
      not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified
      definitions.)

      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A
      suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library
      already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library
      functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a
      modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the
      modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was
      made with.

      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
      to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for
      a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.

      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a
      designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified
      materials from the same place.

      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or
      that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must
include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from
it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not
include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other
proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a
contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an
executable that you distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that
the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other
library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two
things:

      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
      Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be
      distributed under the terms of the Sections above.

      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of
      it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
      accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have
received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their
licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept
this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work
based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library
or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and
conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties with this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on
you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those
who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the
section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people
have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is
up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software
through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical
distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this
License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a
version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you
have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library
does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever
published by the Free Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to
ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions
for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED
IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS"
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.


END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
----------------------------------------------

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these
terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public
License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

      one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.

      Copyright (C) year name of author

      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or

      modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public

      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either

      version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU

      Lesser General Public License for more details.

      You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public

      License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software

      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a
sample; alter the names:

      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in

      the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written

      by James Random Hacker.

      signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990

      Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

  Modifications used by a Contributor, and the Modifications made by that
  particular Contributor.

  1.3. ''Covered Code'' means the Original Code or Modifications or the
  combination of the Original Code and Modifications, in each case including
  portions thereof.

  1.4. ''Electronic Distribution Mechanism'' means a mechanism generally accepted
  in the software development community for the electronic transfer of data.

  1.8.1. "Licensable" means having the right to grant, to the maximum extent
  possible, whether at the time of the initial grant or subsequently acquired,
  any and all of the rights conveyed herein.

  1.9. ''Modifications'' means any addition to or deletion from the substance or
  structure of either the Original Code or any previous Modifications. When
  Covered Code is released as a series of files, a Modification is:

    A. Any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file containing
    Original Code or previous Modifications.

    B. Any new file that contains any part of the Original Code or previous
    Modifications.

  1.10. ''Original Code'' means Source Code of computer software code which is

  available for no charge.

  1.12. "You'' (or "Your") means an individual or a legal entity exercising
  rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License or a future

2. Source Code License.

  2.1. The Initial Developer Grant. The Initial Developer hereby grants You a
  world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party
  intellectual property claims:

    (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
    sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or
    without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

    (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of
    Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale,
    and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Code (or portions thereof).



    (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are effective on the
    date Initial Developer first distributes Original Code under the terms of
    this License.

    (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1)
    for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2) separate from the
    Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused by: i) the modification of the
    Original Code or ii) the combination of the Original Code with other software
    or devices.

  2.2. Contributor Grant. Subject to third party intellectual property claims,
  each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
  license

      (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
    sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or
    portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as
    Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

    (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of
    Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination
    with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination), to make, use,
    sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1)
    Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the
    combination of  Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
    Version (or portions of such combination).

    (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the
    date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Code.

    (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1)
    for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2)
    separate from the Contributor Version;  3)  for infringements caused by: i)
    third party modifications of Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of
    Modifications made by that Contributor with other software  (except as part
    of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
    infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that
    Contributor.


3. Distribution Obligations.

  3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You
  contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without
  limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
  distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this
  License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License
  with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose
  any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable
  version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may
  include an additional document offering the additional rights described in
  Section 3.5.

  3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which
  You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of
  this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an
  accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
  Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution
  Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date
  it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
  version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
  recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
  remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained
  by a third party.

  3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You
  contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that
  Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement
  that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
  provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
  Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable
  version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership
  of the Covered Code.

  3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

    (a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a
    third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
    granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must
    include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL'' which
    describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that
    a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge
    after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
    Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor
    makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
    appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform
    those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

    (b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an application
    programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
    are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include
    this information in the LEGAL file.

            (c)    Representations.

    Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a)
    above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are
    Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights
    to grant the rights conveyed by this License.


  3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file
  of the Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular
  Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
  location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look
  for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your
  name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also
  duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You
  describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.  You
  may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
  liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
  may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer
  or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
  support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
  hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
  liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
  warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

  3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in
  Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for
  that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code
  version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
  including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of
  Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
  Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
  recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
  Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your
  choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You
  are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
  Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in
  the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You
  distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it
  absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by
  You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to
  indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
  incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
  terms You offer.

  3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
  other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
  Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
  of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
  with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order,
  or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
  maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they
  affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
  Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
  Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must
  be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
  understand it.

5. Application of this License.

  This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
  notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

  6.1. New Versions. Netscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may
  publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each
  version will be given a distinguishing version number.

  6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a
  particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the
  terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the
  terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
  other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered
  Code created under this License.

  6.3. Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this License
  (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already
  Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so
  that the phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', "MPL",
  ''NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except
  to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it
  clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the
  Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the
  Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
  Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this
  License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS
IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR
ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
DISCLAIMER. 8. TERMINATION.

  8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such
  breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the
  Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this
  License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
  termination of this License shall survive.

  8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
  (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
  Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such
  action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:

  (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
  any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under
  Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
  Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of
  notice You either: (i)  agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually
  agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made
  by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the
  Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a
  reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in
  writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights
  granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically
  terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

  (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
  Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any
  rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are
  revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or
  had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

  8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
  that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
  any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement)
  prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable
  value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2
  shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment
  or license.

  8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all end
  user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
  validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall
  survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY,
WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR
ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS
SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
APPLY TO YOU. 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

  The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
  2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software'' and
  ''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48
  C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
  227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
  acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

  This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
  hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
  provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
  enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions
  (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
  its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one
  party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in
  the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
  subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of
  California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing
  party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and
  reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations
  Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
  excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
  shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

  As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
  for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization
  of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and
  Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
  herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

  Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
  Multiple-Licensed.  Multiple-Licensedmeans that the Initial Developer permits
  you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the MPL or the
  alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file
  described in Exhibit A.

  license:

    a.

      under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
      Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify,
      display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions,
      either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger

      Contributor Version.


  2.2. Effective Date

  The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become
  effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
  such Contribution.


  2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

  The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
  License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
  or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding
  Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

    a.

      for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

    b.

      for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
      modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
      Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
      Version); or

    c.

      under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
      Contributions.

  This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
  logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice
  requirements in Section 3.4).


  2.4. Subsequent Licenses

  No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute
  the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see
  Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the
  terms of Section 3.3).


  2.5. Representation

  Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are
  its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its
  Contributions conveyed by this License.


  2.6. Fair Use

  This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
  copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.


  2.7. Conditions

  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
  Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities
-------------------


  3.1. Distribution of Source Form

  All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
  Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
  terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of
  the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can
  obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the
  recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.


  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

  If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

    a.

      such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as
      described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable
      Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable
      means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution
      to the recipient; and

    b.

      You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or
      sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the
      Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
      in the Source Code Form under this License.


  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
  provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
  Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with
  a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is
  not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to
  additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary
  License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option,
  further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License
  or such Secondary License(s).


  3.4. Notices

  You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
  copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of
  liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software,
  except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy
  known factual inaccuracies.


  3.5. Application of Additional Terms

  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
  or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
  However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any
  Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
  indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby
  agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such
  Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You
  offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of
  liability specific to any jurisdiction.


4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with
respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or
regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they
affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent
prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently
detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.


5. Termination
--------------

  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
  fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then
  the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are
  reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and
  finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such
  Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means
  prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your
  grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such
  Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this
  is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
  from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your
  receipt of the notice.

  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
  infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and
  cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly
  infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all
  Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall
  terminate.

  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
  license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
  validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
  termination shall survive termination.


6. Disclaimer of Warranty
-------------------------

Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without
warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without
limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as
to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any
Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume
the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of
warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered
Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.


7. Limitation of Liability
--------------------------

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct,
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility
of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for
death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent
applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion
and limitation may not apply to You.


8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and
such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference
to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a
party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.


9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against
a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License
---------------------------


  10.1. New Versions

  Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3,
  no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new
  versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version
  number.


  10.2. Effect of New Versions

  You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the
  License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the
  terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.


  10.3. Modified Versions

  If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a
  new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of
  this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of
  the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from
  this License).


  10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
  Licenses

  If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
  Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice
  described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.


Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice
-------------------------------------------

  This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License,
  v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can
  obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then
You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant
directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.


Exhibit B - "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses" Notice
---------------------------------------------------------

  This Source Code Form is "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses", as defined
  by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

"CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2
==========================================

Certain source files distributed by Sun Microsystems, Inc. are subject to the
following clarification and special exception to the GPL Version 2, but only
where Sun has expressly included in the particular source file's header the words
"Sun designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath" exception as
provided by Sun in the License file that accompanied this code."

Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU
General Public License Version 2 cover the whole combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you permission
to link this library with independent modules to produce an executable,
regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and
distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you
also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the
license of that module. An independent module is a module which is not derived
from or based on this library. If you modify this library, you may extend this
exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to do so. If
you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.

The GNU General Public License (GPL)
------------------------------------


Version 2, June 1991
--------------------

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USAEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most
of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors
commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your
programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer
you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish
to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free
use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  1.  This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
    placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
    of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such
    program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program
    or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing
    the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
    translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included
    without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as
    "you".

    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
    by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program
    is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
    contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been
    made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
    Program does.

  2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
    you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
    appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
    disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
    License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of
    the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
    at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
    forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
    modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
    also meet all of these conditions:

      a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
        that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      b.  You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
        or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
        to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the
        terms of this License.

      c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
        you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
        most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
        appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
        else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
        the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a
        copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive
        but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
        Program is not required to print an announcement.)

    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
    sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
    considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
    and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
    separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
    which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be
    on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
    the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
    rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
    right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
    the Program.

    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
    the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
    distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
    License.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
    Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
    and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

      a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
        code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
        on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
        give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
        performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
        corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections
        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only
        for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
        object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
        Subsection b above.)

    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
    modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all
    the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
    definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
    installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
    code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
    either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
    and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
    component itself accompanies the executable.

    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
    copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
    source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
    even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
    object code.

  5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
    expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
    sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
    terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
    copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
    However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
    Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
    do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
    Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
    this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
    distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
    the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
    copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
    You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of
    the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
    by third parties to this License.

  8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
    you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
    satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
    pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
    Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
    royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
    directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
    it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
    Program.

    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
    the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
    or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
    this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
    software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
    practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
    software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
    application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
    she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
    cannot impose that choice.

    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
    consequence of the rest of this License.

  9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
    countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
    copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
    explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
    that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
    In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
    body of this License.

  10. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
    General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar
    in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
    problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
    version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
    that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
    Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License,
    you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
    whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
    permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
    Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
    exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
    preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
    promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

    NO WARRANTY

  12. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
    THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
    STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
    PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
    INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
    PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
    YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
    ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE
    THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
    GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
    OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR
    DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR
    A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH
    HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which
everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of
warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer
to where the full notice is found.

one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.Copyright (C)

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts
of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called
something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or
menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a
sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
interest in the program `Gnomovision'
(which makes passes at compilers) written
by James Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider
it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If
this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead
of this License.
