 * inside message etc.). To prevent rewrite of all tests we have created this
 * helper class. if the origin ExpectedException is moved away from junit4 we
 * can either reimplement ExpectedException, or we have already moved to junit5
 * where a complete, big refactoring of tests will be necessary (e.g. because
 * method signatures for asserts etc. are totally different) so rules will
 * become obsolete.
