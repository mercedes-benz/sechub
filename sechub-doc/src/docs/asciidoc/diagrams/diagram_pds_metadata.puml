 The callable inspects for changes at the 
 <b>metadata.txt</b> file and will automatically
 store them into <b>meta data column</b> of <b>PDS job entity</b> 
 inside PDS database.
 
 The meta data is <b>product specific</b>. Only the
 product / pds-solution does know what is contained!
 
 The meta data inside the database is just ONE text field.
 Normally it is JSON - but this dependes on the 
 underlying product. If the product does not provide 
 meta data the file does not exist and inside database the 
 column will be "null".
