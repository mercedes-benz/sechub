=== Tech user credentials

Either use system properties

----
sechub.pds.techuser.userid
sechub.pds.techuser.apitoken
----
or env entries
----
SECHUB_PDS_TECHUSER_USERID
SECHUB_PDS_TECHUSER_APITOKEN

to define user credentisals. For apitoken please define encrypted password in spring boot
style - e.g. `{noop}unencrypted`, `{bcrypt}crypted` ...

=== Admin credentials

Either use system properties

sechub.pds.admin.userid
sechub.pds.admin.apitoken
----
or env entries

=== Workspace parent folder
With `-Dsechub.pds.workspace.rootfolder` or using environment variable `SECHUB_PDS_WORKSPACE_ROOTFOLDER`
workspace location can be defined

[[section-pds-server-config-file]]
=== Server configuration file
PDS reads configuration JSON file on startup.

*Location*

With `-Dsechub.pds.config.file=...` or using environment variable `SECHUB_PDS_CONFIG_FILE`
its is possible to set config file path ( when not defined fallback is `./pds-config.json`)

     
* `product-id` +
     Must be *unique* for this product. Allowed characters are [a-zA-Z0-9_]. Maximum length:30. If it's not inside SERECO listed it must provide general sereco report format from #283.

<1> `serverId` is a *unique* identifier, which will be used determine a cluster /server. will be used inside logs and
    also to share common database and divide different pds states etc. +
    Allowed characters are [a-zA-Z0-9_]. Maximum length:30  +
    (e.g `FIND_SECURITY_BUGS_CLUSTER` when providing a PDS server for find-security-bugs). 
    This is *important* ! Do NOT mix up different PDS clusters with same ID. 

<2> product `id` is a unique identifier, which will be used at job configuration time. 
    Defines what will be executed and is also the identifier for SERECO to check for dedicated
    report handling +
    Allowed characters are [a-zA-Z0-9_]. Maximum length:30

<3> `path` defines what command / script will be executed.

<4> `scanType` can be either
 - codeScan
 - infraScan
 - webScan

<5> `description` is a free text description

<6> `parameters` area, here we can define optional and mandatory parameters. Those parameters will be available
    in executed processes by environment variables. +
    All other given job parameters will be IGNORED by server - reason: avoid unwanted changes on system environment variables from caller side 

<7> `mandatory` parameters - server will not accept jobs without these parameters

<8> a `key`, will be transformed to ENV variable. In the given example `product1.qualititycheck.enabled` will be available in execution process 
    as environment variable `PRODUCT1_QUALITYCHECK_ENABLED`.
    the `value`, will be set by {sechub} job call and available in former described ENV entry at execution time.
    {sechub} will 
<9> a 'description' of the 'key'. Should contain information 

<10> optional parameters

<11> defines if PDS will automatically extract ZIP files - default is `true`. When `true` the content
   of the unzipped files will be available inside `$PDS_JOB_WORKSPACE_LOCATION/uploads/unzipped/${nameOfUploadFileWithoutZipExt}`

[options="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
|Variable name                      |Description   
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|PDS_JOB_WORKSPACE_LOCATION         | The workspace job root location 
|PDS_JOB_RESULT_FILE                | The absolute path to the result file _(this file contains security findings)_.
|PDS_JOB_SOURCECODE_ZIP_FILE        | The absolute path to the uploaded "sourcecode.zip" file 
|PDS_JOB_SOURCECODE_UNZIPPED_FOLDER | When auto unzipping is enabled (default) the uploaded source code is unzipped to this folder 
|PDS_SCAN_TARGET_URL                | Target URL for current scan (e.g webscan). Will not be set in all scan types. E.g. for a code scan this environemnt variable will not be available  
|PDS_SCAN_CONFIGURATION             | Contains the SecHub configuration as JSON _(but reduced to current scan type, so e.g. a web scan will have no code scan configuration data available)_ +
                                      + 
                                      For details about the exact format please look into https://mercedes-benz.github.io/sechub/latest/sechub-client.html[SecHub client documentation] . If you are using 
                                      a Java wrapper application inside your PDS scripts, those can use the `sechub-commons-model` java library which contains `SecHubScanConfiguration.java` 
                                      _(Usage is described in JavaDoc)_.

==== Parameter variables
The parameters described at <<section-pds-server-example-config-file,configuration>> are defined in
Product executor configurations. At execution time these parameters are available inside
launcher scripts.

Mandatory parts are always present, optional ones can be empty - dependeing on the executor configuration.
