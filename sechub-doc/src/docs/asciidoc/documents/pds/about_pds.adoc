**About PDS (Product Delegation Server)**

The product delegation server (`PDS`) represents a server which is highly configurable and
can execute any command line tool. It has no runtime dependencies to {sechub}, so it can be used
independently.

Via `PDS` it is possible to easily integrate new security products into SecHub without writing
adapters or executors, because `PDS` is automatically supported as it is a part of the {sechub} ecosystem.

You can use `PDS` instances also highly available in a clustered way - e.g. by using Kubernetes. +
