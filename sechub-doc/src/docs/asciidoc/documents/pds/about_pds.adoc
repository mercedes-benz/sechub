The product delegation server (`PDS`) represents a server which is high configurable and
can execute any command line tool. It has no runtime dependencies to {sechub}, so it can be started
as another server.

Via `PDS` it is possible to easily integrate new security products into SecHub without writing 
adapters or executors, because `PDS` as a part of {sechub} is automatically supported.

You can use `PDS` instances also in a clustered way - e.g. by using Kubernetes and define a service
for the `PDS` PODs.
