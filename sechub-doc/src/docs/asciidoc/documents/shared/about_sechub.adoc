**About {sechub}**

{sechub} is an acronym for "Security Hub" and is first of
all *one API to scan for different security problems*. Users of {sechub} do not
care about which exact product is doing the real scan on server side, but only
configure their wanted aim.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {sechub} server alone does *NOT* provide a security infrastructure but orchestrates different security products/tools.

Please check our ready to use security open source tools: *https://github.com/mercedes-benz/sechub/tree/develop/sechub-pds-solutions[PDS solutions]* for integration with {sechub} server.
====

It was designed to be very easy to integrate into existing
build / contionus integration (CI) pipelines and helps to provide
**SecDevOps**.
