**About {sechub}**

{sechub} stands for "Security Hub" and serves as an unified API
to scan for various security issues.
With {sechub}, users don't need to worry about the specific scanning product
used on the server side; they simply configure their desired security goals.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {sechub} server alone does *NOT* provide a security infrastructure but orchestrates different security products/tools.

Please check our ready to use security open source tools: *https://github.com/mercedes-benz/sechub/tree/develop/sechub-pds-solutions[PDS solutions]* for integration with {sechub} server.
====

It was designed to be very easy to integrate into existing
build / contionus integration (CI) pipelines and helps to provide
**SecDevOps**.

[TIP]
