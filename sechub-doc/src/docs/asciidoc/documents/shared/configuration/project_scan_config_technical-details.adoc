A `ScanProjectConfigService` provides access to `ScanProjectConfig` entities for a given 
`ScanProjectConfigID` key for a dedicated project. 
It is similar to `ScanConfigService` which provides a global <<scan-config-about,scan configuration>>.

We currently store the following types of data through this mechanism:

- Mock configuration
- <<section-concept-false-positive-technical-details,False positive configuration>> false positive configuration
- Project access level
