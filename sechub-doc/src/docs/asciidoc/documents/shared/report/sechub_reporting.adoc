== Reporting
This chapter describes the different {sechub} reports and how to read them.

At the moment {sechub} only provides job reports and no cumulated reports.
Job reports do only contain information of exact one scan job done by {sechub}.

TIP: If you want to have management summaries you could store downloaded JSON job reports
 , process data and provide those reports by your own - or you wait while this
 becomes part of {sechub}.
  
=== Job reports
With {sechub} users are able to download their scan results for finished project jobs. We provide following 
formats:
 
- HTML +
  human friendly report variant with less details
- JSON +
  as a machine readable format, usable for sechub client to determine to break build. Will also be
  the base for planned development of IDE plugins (`Eclipse`, `IntelliJ`, `VSCode`)

ifdef::techdoc[]
NOTE: If you are interested in technical details/ development situation you can take a look at https://github.com/mercedes-benz/sechub/issues/68. Newer changes
      /additions in report should normally reference this base issue always, so it is a good starting point.

==== HTML

The main purpose for the HTML report is to have a human friendly report which gives you a fast overview
to your current situation.

* At the left top corner you see a traffic light showing either
** GREEN
** YELLOW or
** RED.

===== Example code scan report with red traffic light
The next picture shows a report which resulted in a red traffic light.

At the top of the report you will find the most critical parts - in our example it is a red finding which is a `Command Injection`. If available for this type of finding, you can find the corresponding CWE-Id (Common Weakness Enumeration) as a link to the knowledge base of MITRE in the `Type` column. 

The data sink with Id 9 (where the command injection could lead to problems at the end) is at the top of the Description field.

[NOTE]
====

You can open the complete call hierarchy by clicking on "Open full callstack". This allows you to see the full hierarchy from entry point up to data sink and can help you in analyzing this finding.

====

There are other findings (yellow and green) which are less problematic.

TIP: {sechub} client will break your build per default only at a RED traffic light, but you can also
configure the client to do this also on color YELLOW. Only Green is always accepted.

===== What about descriptions and mitigation suggestions?
At the moment {sechub} does not contain this inside it's reports, but this feature will come in future

==== JSON

This is the machine readable report format.

     _in our case an `Absolute path traversal` where attackers could try to manipulate path input, so output could contain unwanted content/wrong file (e.g. a passwd file etc.)_
