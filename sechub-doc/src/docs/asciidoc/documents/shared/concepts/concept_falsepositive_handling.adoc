[[concept-false-positive-handling]]
=== False-positive handling

{sechub} must be able to handle false positives of used products.

==== General

===== How can false positives be handled across multiple security products?
====== Problem 
1. Missing API +
 
Most commercial security products are able to mark false positives, but maybe not every tool has a dedicated API for this feature. In addition, many FOSS security tools do not
support false positive handling.   

====== Solution
Instead of configuring false positives for each product (e.g. by calling a REST API)
we do the filtering of false positives always at {sechub} side only!

The involved product just returns all it's findings without any false positive marking on the product side.
{sechub} will store the product results in the database without any filtering.

Only when it comes to report generation at the end, {sechub} will filter the false positives from
the result. This makes it easy to debug - the original information from the product is still 
available and problems on false positive marking can be reproduced and fixed. 

===== Different kinds of false-positive filtering
Some people prefer code/API-centric way to define false positives, some prefer a WebUI.


[[section-concept-false-positive-general-api-centric]]
====== API centric
 
include::../false-positives/false-positives-howto-define-by-api.adoc[]


[[section-concept-false-positive-general-web-ui]]
====== Web UI

Just uses the API centric approach (by using given REST API,) over UI. 

[[section-concept-false-positive-general-code-centric]]
====== Code centric
Inside source code / deployment scripts etc. users can define comments to define false positive handling
- *this is only possible* for situations *where* we have *access to source code* - means SAST 
(static application security testing)

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently this is not supported!

The detection algorithm is already implemented inside `sechub-anlyzer-cli` 
but we still have no `analyzer phase` and a `PDS solution` to collect these code information automatically. +
So this will still need some time.

==== Code scan

===== API centric
see <<section-concept-false-positive-general-api-centric,general concept>> 

====== How to identify same vulnerability on code changes?
- We inspect source and sink and use
  * Location
  * relevant part - this is absolutely necessary.
- Line numbers must always be irrelevant!

[IMPORTANT]
====
Very important for Sereco: If no relevant part is available we must at least create a
pseudo one by given source snippet - in a whitespace reduced form! 
We will compress the source content, so 
adding new lines, spaces, tabs etc. would not matter.

So if a product does not support "relevant part" detection we must create the "relevant
part" inside `Sereco` as fallback! 
====
 
===== Web UI
see <<section-concept-false-positive-general-web-ui,general concept>> 

===== Code centric

[IMPORTANT]
====
This approach is currently not enabled/full supported!

Details:
`CLI analyzer` is already implemented which contains logic for search etc, but currently
{sechub} does not use it because there is a need for PDS execution. We also need a 
special type of executions introduced: `AnalyzerProductExecutor`, which is not at this moment.
====

Inside source code the developers will be able to mark their code, marked as vulnerable, as 
being a false positive by using comments. After the push to repository it's inside history who
was defining the vulnerability as a false positive.

We use following tags:

`NOSECHUB`

and

`NOSECHUB-END`
 
[NOTE]
====
In future we could provide additional identifiers for `NOSECHUB` to define which kind of
false positive is ignored/will not be fixed. The kind/type must be product independant defined and clear to understand. Maybe a CWE ID would be the best choice.

E.g. `NOSECHUB:CWE-79`

====

====== Java

We will provide single comments (`//`) 
[source,java]
----
include::../false-positives/FalsePositiveJavaApplication.java[]
----
<1> marks start
<2> marks end

All between those tags will be ignored by {sechub}.


==== Web scan

===== Code centric
Not possible

===== API centric
see <<section-concept-false-positive-general-api-centric,general concept>> 

===== Web UI
see <<section-concept-false-positive-general-web-ui,general concept>> 

==== Infra scan

===== Code centric
Not possible

===== API centric
see <<section-concept-false-positive-general-api-centric,general concept>> 

[NOTE]
====

The identification of similarity is done here by 

- Code scans: CWE id
- Web scans: CWE id

For infrastructure scans a false positive detection is currently not implemented.
