[[section-analytic]]
{sechub} can be configured to analyze a scan situation at the beginning to improve runtime behavior or to create statistic data. 
This is done before all other scans. 


[NOTE]
====
As usual, different products can be used to provide the analytic data. The analytic scan products can be configured as any other product by defining a <<section-executor-configuration,executor configuration>> and add it to a 
<<section-initial-profile-and-executors,execution profile>> which can be assigned to {sechub} projects.
