When a new {pds} deployment starts, running jobs must be treated in a way that the running jobs
are "transfered" to the new instances.

This is done following way:

`SIGTERM` signal from OS is recognized and still running jobs are set to state `READY_FOR_RESTART`.

Because the job stores its state via meta data (see <<concept-pds_solution_metadata,{pds} meta data>> )
it is possible reuse/relaunch the job from new instances. The {pds} scheduler mechanism to determine
next job to start handles this state before others.
 
[NOTE]
====
K8s (Kubernetes) sends a SIGTERM signal when doing rolling updates. Means we have here a zero down 
time with K8s + {pds}.
====

[WARNING]
====
Other signals (e.g. `SIGKILL`) are *NOT treated*! For those cases the jobs must be restarted manually
afterwards.
