The `AnalyticsProductExecutionService` inside the `scan` domain does not only execute and store the product results, but
also creates an analytic data model after the analytic scan products have been executed.

This data model can be used at runtime by other product executors inside the `scan` domain but also in other domains via domain messaging.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently the information is not used at runtime by other product executors but only inside <<section-statistic,statistic domain>>.
