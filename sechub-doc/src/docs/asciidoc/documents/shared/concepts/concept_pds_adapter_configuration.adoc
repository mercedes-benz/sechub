[[concept-pds_adapter_configuration]]
The different PDS product executors have different config builders which inherit from different abstract base classes
(e.g. `AbstractCodeScanAdapterConfigBuilder`). We have no multi inheritance in Java, but we do also not 
want to implement the setup logic (which is complicated) for every PDS product executor again.

There is a specialized adapter configuration strategy for PDS standard setup: `PDSAdapterConfigurationStrategy`.
