==== Configuration
Administrators can configure the auto cleanup configuration by uploading a json configuration via
REST (see <<section-ucrestdoc-uc-UC_065,REST API for UC_065-Admin updates auto cleanup configuration >>).

<1> The time unit to use. +
    Can be 
    - day(s), DAY(S) 
    - month(s), MONTH(S)
    - week(s), WEEK(S) or
    - year(s), YEAR(S) +
    
<2> Amount of time. When `0` is defined, the auto cleanup is deactivated, all other positive values are time 
    unit related. Negative values are not allowed.

==== Execution
The execution is automatically done by {sechub}. 

==== Cleaned data
All data which is older than the defined time period is removed from:

- Scan product results
- Scan project log 
- Schedule job entries
- Administration job information

[NOTE]
====
Scan report data is currently NOT deleted. So it can be used for statistics.
In a later feature there will be specialized statistic tables - when this has been implemented,
the auto cleanup will be extended to drop old scan report data as well.
