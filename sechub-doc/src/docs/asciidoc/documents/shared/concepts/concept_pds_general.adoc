==== General
===== PDS In an nutshell
There are many open source clients available having no server component inside so lacking:

- REST access
- queuing
- status requests
- scalable
- â€¦ more

So when we want to adapt them in {sechub} style _(the product does the work and we ask for result)_ we
need to provide a `ProductDelegationServer` (in short form `PDS`).

`PDS` is

- a spring boot application which uses a network DB for providing cluster possibility
- a complete standalone application without runtime dependencies to {sechub} server (or its shared kernel)
- provides REST access
- a very simple priviledge model with just two users (`tech user` + `admin user`),
  basic auth via `TLS`, credentials are simply defined by environment entries on startup
- provides jobs, queing, monitoring etc.
- can execute single files (e.g. a bash script), where job parameters are
  available as environment variables at runtime
- a standard way to integrate any product into {sechub} in a scalable and easy way

===== Handling of resources
- PDS server provides `auto unzipping` of uploaded resources when configured  - see <<section-pds-server-config-file,PDS server configuration file>>
- When a PDS job fails or is done the resources inside job workspace location are *automatically removed*

===== Communication between SecHub and PDS
The communication between SecHub server and PDS is very similar to the communication between SecHub client and SecHub server.
The `PDS adapter` will do following steps from {sechub} side - as a client of {pds}:

. creates a {pds} job
. _(Optional: Only necessary when {pds} does not resuse {sechub} storage)_ uploads sources and/or binaries to {pds}
. approves {pds} job
. waits until {pds} job has finished
. downloads {pds} report data
