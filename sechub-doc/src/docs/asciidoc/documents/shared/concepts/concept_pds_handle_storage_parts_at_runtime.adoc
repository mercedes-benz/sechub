The `PDS` does automatically fetch uploaded files from shared <<pds-storage-and-sharing,storage>> 
temporary into its local filesystem. After the scan has been done, the temporary local files
will be automatically deleted. 

[[pds-fetches-sourcecode-from-storage]]
====== Source code fetching
Source code is always contained in a file called `sourcecode.zip`.
When a `PDS` starts a new job, it will fetch the complete ZIP file from <<pds-storage-and-sharing,storage>>
to it's local storage at

`${PDSJobWorkspaceLocation}/upload/sourcecode.zip`.

Afterwards the <<pds-automated-extraction-sourcecode,relevant sources will be automatically extracted>> by inspecting
the archive <<pds-explanation-data-structure,data structure>>.

[[pds-fetches-binaries-from-storage]]
====== Binaries fetching
Binaries are always contained in a file called `binaries.tar`.
When a `PDS` starts a new job and the scan does references a binary data section, it will fetch 
the complete TAR file from <<pds-storage-and-sharing,storage>> to it's local storage at
 
`${WorkspaceLocation}/upload/binaries.tar`. 

Afterwards the <<pds-automated-extraction-binaries,relevant binaries will be automatically extracted>> by inspecting
the archive <<pds-explanation-data-structure,data structure>>.

// FIXME 2022-05-06, de-jcup: remove this after binaries are fetched by PDS!
[CAUTION]
====
The binary fetching  is currently not yet implemented!

====== Automated Extraction of relevant parts
Only files and folders which are available for the configured scan type will be automatically 
extracted! +
The artificial path element `\__data__` and the reference name will not be contained in extracted 
folders.

*Automated extraction of source code* +

Let's assume PDS has <<pds-fetches-sourcecode-from-storage,fetched>> `sourcezip.zip` which contains following structure:
[source,shell, title="ZIP file example content"]
----
__data__/
    license-sources/ 
            somewhere/
                     file1a.txt 
                     subfolder1/
                        file1b.txt
            file2.txt
    other-sources/ 
            file3.txt 
   
----

and a {sechub} configuration file like this:

[source,json]
----
{
    // .. assume data section and other parts are configured correctly .. 
    
    "licenseScan": { 
        "use" : ["license-sources"]
    },
    "codeScan": { 
        "use" : ["other-sources"]
    }
}
----

In the example the {sechub} configuration has a license scan configured which references 
`license-sources` data configuration and a code scan which references `other-sources`.
The `PDS` for license scanning will only extract `license-sources`:

[source,shell, title="Output of automated ZIP file extraction by PDS"]
----
${PDSJobWorkspaceLocation}/upload/unzipped/sourcecode
                                       somewhere/
                                            file1a.txt
                                            subfolder1/
                                               file1b.txt
                                       file2.txt
----

[NOTE]
====
`file3.txt` was not extracted, because it is not available for the license scan.
