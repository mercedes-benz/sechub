Inside a {pds} workspace a special messages folder exists. The launcher script can create there
dedicated user message files by creating simple text files (see <<table-link-pds-launcher-script-variable-messages,PDS_JOB_USER_MESSAGES_FOLDER>>  
for details) . After the job has been done (or failed),  
all files located at this folder are collected and stored as a JSON representing a `SecHubMessageList` inside the 
{pds} Job. Those {sechub} messages can be fetched by technical user via REST API.
