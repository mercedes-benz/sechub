==== Templates and assets
===== About 
When it comes to complex configurations it can be cumbersome for {sechub} users, difficult for support
and - depending on the product - very hard to provide a complete generic approach via {sechub}  configuration
only. 

===== Example situation
To clarify this abstract situation here an example: +

Think about a wide range of applications inside a corporation which want to use a common 
single sign on with multi factor authentication and some other specific parts.

The login configuration would become complex and error prone because not every user would
understand exactly what to do. If the single-signon mechanism would change, every project/user
would need to change their {sechub} configuration files! When talking about hundreds of projects
this would be a great effort - for users and for support!

And let us assume the used product has hundreds of options which cannot be configured
by a generic approach easily (e.g. form login definition in configuration): How could this product
be provided in a desired way then?
 
And what if there are some specific parts which are not 100% same in every of these projects? 
 
This is the reason for the "templates and assets" concept which is described below.

===== Templates
{sechub} can have multiple templates . Every template has a type and can contains a set of 
assets and also a variable definition. It can be administrated via
REST end points:

```
PUT    /api/administration/template/$template-id
GET    /api/administration/template/$template-id
DELETE /api/administration/template/$template-id
```

PUT will contain following body:

[source,json]
----
{
    "type" : "webscan-login",//<1>
    "assets" : ["asset-id-1"]//<2>
    "variables" : {//<3>
        "username" : "mandatory",//<4>
        "password" : "mandatory",
        "tip-of-the-day" : "optional"//<5>
    }
}
----
<1> The type of the template. Currently possible: `webscan-login`
<2> Array with asset identifiers assigned to the template
<3> Variable definitions as list of key and value pairs which can be mandatory or optional. 
Via the type {sechub} server is able to check if the configuration is valid and give 
response to users when job starts.

===== Mapping templates to projects
```
PUT     /api/admin/project/$projectId/template/$templateid
DELETE  /api/admin/project/$projectId/template/$templateid
GET     /api/admin/project/$projectId/template/list
```

[IMPORTANT]
====
The mapping is stored with template type as part of the composite key: 
If two template definitions with same type are uploaded, the last one will
overwrite the first one.
====

===== SecHub configuration file
The users can now define in their {sechub} configuration file that they want to use the
configured template for web scanning by defining a templateData section inside the login
configuration.

For example:
[source,json]
----
include::../configuration/sechub_config_example22_webscan_with_template.json[]
----
<1> Define template data for the login. The user
is not able to define which template is used.
<2> Setup template variables by a list of key and value pairs. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the user has defined a `templateData` section in the configuration but no template of that type is assigned to the project, a
dedicated error message must be returned to the user and the {sechub} job will always fail.
====

===== Asset storage
The assets are initially stored in {sechub} database, together with the asset file checksum.

When a template is used inside a  {sechub} configuration, the {sechub} start mechanism will 
check if the file from database is already available at storage (S3/NFS) which represents
a cache for the assets.

If available, the cached part will be used. Otherwise it will be uploaded
(see  <<sechub-concept-asset-upload-lazy,{sechub} lazy asset upload to storage>> )


[TIP]
====
Main reason why we store always in DB and use storage (S3/NFS) as a cache only:

1. Restore a DB backup on a fresh installation:  +
   Administrators can just apply the database backup and everything works again
2. Storage could be volatile/be deleted etc. (we rely to the database)
3. For having two clusters ( {sechub} and {pds} having not same database we need
   a way to exchange.
====


[IMPORTANT]
====
For templates and assets we use the shared storage between {sechub} and {pds} .
solutions and not to provide own storage for {pds}. Diffeent storages are not supported here.
====

`/assets/$assetId/`

An asset id has

- maximum length of 40
- can contain only `a-z` `A-Z`, `0-9` or  `-` or `_`

At the storage for each product (as named in the `pds-config.json` of the {pds} solution), there will be a ZIP file having the 
product identifier as filename

For example:
```
/assets/
   asset-id-1/
      PDS_OWASP_ZAP.zip
      PDS_OWASP_ZAP.zip.sha256
      OTHER_PRODUCT_X.zip
      OTHER_PRODUCT_X.zip.sha256
```
[TIP]
====
The content and the structure inside the ZIP files is absolute solution specific :
The PDS solution defines which kind of template data is necessary and how the 
structure looks like!
====

===== Administration REST end points for storage
Over REST API Administrators will be able to 

- list (ZIP) file names +
  `GET /api/administration/asset/$assetId/list`
- upload asset ZIP files by REST API and create checksum file +
  `PUT /api/administration/asset/$assetId/$productId`
- download asset files by REST API  +
  `GET /api/administration/asset/$assetId/$productId`
- delete single asset file by REST API  +
  `DELETE /api/administration/asset/$assetId/$productId`
- delete all asset files by REST API  +
  `DELETE /api/administration/asset/$assetId`

The REST API will always create an audit log entry 

[IMPORTANT]
====
This works only when the storage is shared between {sechub} and {pds}.
If the {pds} uses its own storage (which should NOT be done for production, but only
for PDS solution development) the assets must be uploaded directly to the PDS storage 
location! 
====

===== SecHub template and asset handling
====== Validation
When a {sechub} job starts and there is a template data definition inside the configuration, 
{sechub} will validate if the project has a template assigned for the location inside
the configuration. e.g. templates with type `webscan-login` may only be defined inside 
web scan login configuration).

If this validation fails, the complete {sechub} job will fail and stop processing.

[[sechub-concept-asset-upload-lazy]]
====== Upload in storage as cache lazily
When validation did not fail, {sechub} will check if the current version of the asset is already uploaded to
storage (S3/NFS) already.

When not uploaded to storage, the file will be uploaded before the job is further processed.

====== Template PDS parameter calculation
If validation and lazy upload did not fail, {sechub} will calculate a
{pds} parameter : `pds.template.metadata` with JSON (see parameter syntax for details).

.PDS parameter syntax for template meta data 
[source,json]
----
{
    "template-metadata" : [ //<1>
        {
            "template" : "single-singon", //<2>
            "type": "webscan-login",//<3>
            "assets" : [ //<4>
                {
                    "id" : "asset-id-1", //<5>
                    "sha256" : "434c6c6ec1b0ed9844149069d7d45ac18e72505b" //<6> 
                }
            ]
        }]
    }     
}

----
<1> Meta data array
<2> Template identifier - just as an information for logging etc.
<3> Template type
<4> Asset information array
<5> ID of the asset, necessary for storage download
<6> checksum of the asset ZIP file, necessary to check after download

===== PDS asset handling
{sechub} calls {pds}, with {pds} parameter `pds.template.metadata` (syntax is described above).

The {pds} intance will fetch all wanted asset ZIP file for the current product 
from storage (S3 or NFS) and extract it to `$workspaceFolder/assets/`. 

Before extraction is done a checksum for the downloaded ZIP file is created and compared
with the checksum from template meta data. If it is different the {pds} job will fail
with a dedicated error message.

If the checksum is valid, the assets ZIP file will be unzipped below a subfolder with the 
template type:
 
[source,text]
----
`$workspaceFolder/
     assets/
        $template-type/
                    ...
----

An example:

The `MY_PRODUCT.zip` file contains

[source,text]
----
/script.js
/development/
             debug-settings.json
----

and the template meta data looks like this:

[source,text]
----
{
    "template-metadata" : {
        {
            "type: "webscan-login",
            "assets" : [
                {
                    "id" : "asset-id-1",
                    "sha256" : "434c6c6ec1b0ed9844149069d7d45ac18e72505b" 
                }
            ]
        }
    }     
}
----


It will be extracted the following way.

[source,text]
----
`$workspaceFolder/
     assets/
        webscan-login/
                    script.js
                    develoment/
                              debug-settings.json
   
----

====== Pseudo code for usage inside PDS solutions/wrappers

Here an example (but pseudo code) how a product could use the assets inside:

[source,java]
----
WebScanTemplateData data = util.fetchWebScanTemplateData(sechubConfig);
if (data!=null){
    // folder=/$workspaceFolder/assets
    File folder = util.getAssetFolder();
    
    // in example: it is a web scan...
    script = folder.getChild("webscan-login/script.js");
    
    script = replaceVariableInScript(data.getVariable("username"), script);
    script = replaceVariableInScript(data.getVariable("password"), script);
    
    // use script....
}
