=== PDS solutions

It is easy to integrate security products, even command line tools without a network API, into 
`SecHub` via `PDS` (Product delegation server).

A PDS solution is a ready-made package for SecHub in which a PDS and the necessary security
products are already pre-installed and can be used directly without additional adjustments.

TIP: The PDS solutions can be found at {projectSite}/tree/develop/sechub-pds-solutions.
