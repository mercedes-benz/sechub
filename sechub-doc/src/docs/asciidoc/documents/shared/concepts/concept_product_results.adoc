=== Product results
Product results can be either from security products or from reporting products.

For a job different security products can be executed, depending on the <<section-concepts-product-execution,execution configuration>>. 
After this the results will be stored in database as dedicated `ProductResult` entries.

Afterwards reporting products will be executed to collect the former stored reports and merge them together.
The report product merge result will be stored as a `ProductResult` as well in database for the job.

NOTE: When no report collector is configured/available the embedded report product `Sereco` ("SecHub report collector") will be used .
