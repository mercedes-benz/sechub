=== Product execution profiles and executor configuration

To have the possibility of using dedicated security products for different projects, to 
disable/enable products on demand without server restart or just to test new products in one evaluation project but
not for all other projects a runtime configuration is necessary.

This is provided by execution profiles and and executor configurations.   

==== Overview
plantuml::diagrams/diagram_overview_execution_profiles_and_config.puml[format=svg, title="Overview profiles and configurations"]  

==== Executor configuration
An executor configuration represents a runtime configuration for product executors. The configuration
has an enabled state. So it is possible to enable/disable product execution.

==== Execution profile
An execution profile can contain multiple executor configurations. The configurations can be shared 
between multiple profiles. E.g. a config with name "pds-gosec-1" can be used in profiles "profileA"
and also "profileB" at the same time. 

Additionally a profile can be assigned to a project _(but technically we assign a projectId to a profile, because
in domain `scan` we only know projectIds but no the `Project` entity...)_.

The profile has also an enabled state - like executors. 

==== How execution process uses profiles and configurations 
`ScanService` is called by {sechub} batch operation from scheduler and contains the project id for the
project to scan for. 

When it comes to execution, `ProductExectionStoreService` fetches all enabled profiles related to the given
project id and executes all enabled product executors for the wanted scan job - e.g. code scan product executors

===== Results handling done by configured report executor or fallback
All of the results returned by the dedicated product executors are stored in database. After this has been done,
the configured report product executor(s) is (are) executed _(if none has been defined in at least one profile, the
fallback will automatically use `Sereco` product executor version 1, which is embedded)_
