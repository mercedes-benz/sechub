Defining false positives is done by declaring false positive information in a `JSON` file

- by referencing *<<section-false-positives-defined-via-jobData,job results>>* from former {sechub} job UUID and the corresponding finding entry (by id) and/or
- by specifying a *<<section-false-positives-defined-via-projectData,project data>>* section where specific patterns that match false positive findings are declared

and post it to the SecHub server REST API. 

[NOTE]
====
The `jobData` approach is very generic and easy to use: It references a SecHub report. Every false-positive in any kind of scan can be handled like that.
====

[NOTE]
====
The `projectData` approach is more powerful for the user because wildcards can be used.

Each entry can be updated or removed by the given `id`. +
Declaring a projectData entry with an already existing `id`, will update its content with the new data.

*Example JSON using job results*

[source,json]
----
include::false-positives-REST-API-content-example1.json[]
----
<1> `apiVersion` _(mandatory)_ - API version
<2> `type` _(mandatory)_ - must be `falsePositiveDataList`
<3> `jobData` - List of job data that is used to mark a single finding as a false positive
<4> jobData.`jobUUID` _(mandatory)_ SecHub Job-UUID of the report where the finding was
<5> jobData.`findingId` _(mandatory)_ Finding ID which shall be marked as false positive
<6> jobData.`comment` _(optional)_ A comment describing the reason why this is a false positive


[[section-false-positives-defined-via-projectData]]
*Example JSON using project data*

[source,json]
----
include::false-positives-REST-API-content-example2.json[]
----
<1> `apiVersion` _(mandatory)_ - API version
<2> `type` _(mandatory)_ - must be `falsePositiveDataList`
<3> `projectData` - List that can be used to mark more than a single finding as a false positive. Currently only available for web scans.
<4> projectData.`id` that identifies this entry. If the same `id` is used again,
the existing false positive entry will be overwritten. The `id` is also mandatory to unmark this entry. 
<5> projectData.`webScan` _(optional)_ section can be used to define false positive patterns for web scans (DAST). It provides more possibilities to the user than above jobData.
<6> projectData.webScan.`cweId` is used to mark a certain type of finding as false positive. +
When handling web scan project data this will be treated as a _mandatory_ field. +
Please insert here the cweId from the original report. +
If there was no cweId in the original report, then it must be omitted or set to zero `"cweId": 0`.
<7> projectData.webScan.`urlPattern` (_mandatory_) specifies an URL pattern to identify a false positive.
Asterisks can be used as wildcards e.g. if you have different environments like DEV, INT, PROD or you have variable parts like in API calls or query paramaters `https://*.example.com/rest/*/search?*`.
<8> projectData.webScan.`methods` _(optional)_ Can be used to further restrict the false positive matching, to specific request methods protocols, like GET, POST, etc.


Important information on the wildcard approach in `projectData`, regarding web scans: +
- To be marked as a false positive a finding must match the given `cweId` and the `urlPattern` +
- Wildcards (`pass:[*]`) can be used inside `urlPattern`. +
- Wildcards match anything until the next NON-wildcard character. +
- Multiple wildcards can be used in one `urlPattern`. +
- An _optional_ list of (HTTP) methods can be specified to limit the false positive entry to certain `methods`, e.g if you specify `"methods": [ "GET", "DELETE" ]` like in the example above that means even if the `cweId` and the `urlPattern` are matching, if the finding was found with a `POST` request it would not be a false positive. When leaving `methods` out, this false positive entry apply to any method. +
- An `urlPattern` which contains only wildcards (`pass:[*]`) is not allowed.
