==== Versioning
[[sechub-versioning-in-code]]
===== Versions are defined in GIT
Version numbering is done by Developers while adding Tags on GIT system to
commit which is used for build.

`vX.Y.Z-server` tags are used to define a new server version and
`vX.Y.Z-client` will define a new client version.

To have GIT tags always uploaded, developers must be aware of the correct
<<sechub-git-configuration,git configuration>> at their local development machine.

TIP: GitHub releases (versions) should be ideal to work with!

===== Versions used/created at build time

General used version at build time looks always like: `$versionId-$buildId`
For example `1.2.3-b123`

NOTE: Every gradle build will regenerate the versioning. Why? Because the gradle configuration
      phase is always done for ALL gradle builds. This includes version setup for build.
      Means for example: Setting version for server into file only when server build task
      will be run does not work, because version setting would be configured before. +
       +
      We want to ensure that EVERY change to git will have influence to created version,
      so its absolutely necessary to ensure version represents always the commit state! +
       +
      So *DO NOT change* creating version on every build call! +
      Having a build problem because something has changed (e.g. generated parts) ensure
      `.gitignore` is correctly defined!



====== Version Id
* *Dedicated version* +
  Commits having a dedicated version tag will lead to a reduced version info
  containing only tag data E.g. a tag with `v1.2.3` will lead to version starting
  with `1.2.3`

* *Commmit ID version* +
  When no tag defined the version looks like
  `0.0.0-$abreviatedCommitId`. So its still clear which commit this version is. +
  For example `0.0.0-cfe34f5`

* *Dirty version* +
  When file system has changed to origin commit the version will be look like
  `0.0.0-$abreviatedCommitId-dirty`  additionally  with `"-dirty"`. +
  For example `0.0.0-cfe34f5-dirty`

====== Build Id
[[section-versioning-local-builds]]
* *Local builds* +
  do normally contain a timestamp  -e.g . `20190213105029`. +
   +
  *Using 'latest' instead timestamp* +
  If you set gradle property
  `sechub.build.timestamp` to `false` instead of the time stamp you will get always
  `latest` as build id! So for example: `0.0.0-cfe34f5-dirty-latest`. +
   You can do this with calling `./gradlew build -Psechub.build.timestamp=false` or
   if you want this behaviour always, just define it inside `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`

[[section-versioning-server-builds]]
* *Server builds* +
  will starts with a `b` and real build number. The build number must be set as environment +
  variable `BUILD_NUMBER`.
  For example:
