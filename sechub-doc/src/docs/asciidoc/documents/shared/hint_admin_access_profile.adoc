Please *don't forget* to have *at least one server* running with active profile `admin_access`!

Servers without having this profile activated, will provide only standard API access.
Reason for this behavior: Administrators can reduce access to administrative API by IP and
port firewall settings.

This is only necessary for production! Development and Integrationtest profiles do automatically include
the `admin_access` profile.

*An example for production:* +
In a Kubernetes environment you could  start 5 instances of {sechub} without this profile at port 443 and 2 additional ones with `admin_access` profile
enabled on port 8443 (all other settings are same). In your firewall configuration you allow public
access to this server by port 443, but access to port 8443 is restricted to some dedicated IPs.
