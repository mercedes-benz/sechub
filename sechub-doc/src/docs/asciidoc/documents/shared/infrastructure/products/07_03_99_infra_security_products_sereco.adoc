==== Sereco

`Sereco` is not a product to buy but a own developed `sechub report collector`.

Why an own report collector? We formerly did try to use an commercial tool,
but we were stuck with many problems, e.g.

- crucial problems with installation
- no clustering
- missing REST API for imports
- not supporting some product results
- ... more...

===== Install
The software comes currently up with {sechub} server installation. So nothing more is to do.

Scaling etc. is done with {sechub} scaling.

====== Future
Currently `Sereco` is an embedded component of `{sechub}`. Maybe there comes a time where `Sereco` will become a seperate server component which will be deployed standalone.
If so there are some changes to do (e.g. creating a rest API) etc. But as long as there is no need for a separate installation
it makes no sense to change this.
