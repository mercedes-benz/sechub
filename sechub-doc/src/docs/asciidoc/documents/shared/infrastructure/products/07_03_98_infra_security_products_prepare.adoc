==== Prepare (Remote Data Preparation)

`Prepare` is not a scan product, but a developed wrapper application to prepare remote sources for scans.
It is used to download remote sources and upload them to the shared storage make them available to the scan products.
This enables the user to scan remote data without the need to store them local on a machine an upload it with the client.

The `remote` section can be defined in the sechub configuration instead of the `filesystem`.

Please note the PDS prepare can only be executed with a **shared storage setup**.
These limitations are due to the fact, that the sechub server can not download sources from a PDS and copy them to another.
