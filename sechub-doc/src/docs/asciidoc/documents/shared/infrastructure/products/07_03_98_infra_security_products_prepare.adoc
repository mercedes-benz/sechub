==== Prepare

`Prepare` is not a scan product, but a developed wrapper to download remote sources.
It is used to download remote sources and upload them to the shared storage make them available to the scan products.
The prepare-wrapper application can be run with the PDS prepare solution and implements the PREPARE phase.

Please note the PDS prepare can only be executed with a shared storage setup.
These limitations are due to the fact, that the sechub server can not download sources from a PDS and copy them to another.
