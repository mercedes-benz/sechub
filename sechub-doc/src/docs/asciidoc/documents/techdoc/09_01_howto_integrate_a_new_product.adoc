=== Howto integrate a new product

At the beginning of {sechub} it was always necessary to implement a new product adapter (in Java), create 
a new product executor (in Java) and create new product result importer (also in Java).

*Those days are gone*. Nowadays we are shifting every new product into a {pds} (product delegation server)
 solution. For {pds} we have an already existing {pds} adapter (the logic to communicate with {pds})
 which is used always.
 
 
[IMPORTANT]
====
At the moment we have still some direct product adapters. Some are marked as deprecated and will
vanish. Others will be replaced by PDS solutions.

In the future there shall be only two products which have dedicated adapter implementations: SERECO and {pds}.
====
 
For every existing type of scan there is a dedicated {pds} product executor available. When the security 
product is able to produce SARIF output, we are able to import this already.
You can find multiple existing solutions and more details at {pds-solutions-projectsite}.

[NOTE]
====
In the best case scenario there is no need to write anything in Java - we copy an existing
pds-solution to a new folder name, make some necessary adjustments, change the caller script and we are done...
 
Only when a product result is not already supported by SERECO ({sechub} report collector), 
we must write a special `ProductResultImporter`.
