=== Howto configure mock behaviours

==== Default mock adapter used in {sechub} integration tests
The `MockedAdapterSetupService` reads a JSON configfile from file path.

Default file is located at `/sechub-other/mockdata/mockdata_setup.json`

If you want to use another location, use system property defined in
`MockedAdapterSetupService.java` to define another location.

Example:

include::mockdata_setup_example1.adoc[]

==== Project specific mock adapter behaviour
Users can define a mock configuration via REST. This is
convenient for integration tests from foreign systems. But there can
*not* be any product specific configuration.
