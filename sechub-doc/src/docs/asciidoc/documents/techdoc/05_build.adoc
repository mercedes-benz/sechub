=== About build technology

Leading entry point/technology is always `gradle`. So if you want to build something, please look at the
corresponding gradle tasks.

We use `github-actions` for CI which gives quick us a quick response at
`github.com`. For automated deployment or S3 storage testing etc. Jenkins can
 be used by defined pipeline scripts.
