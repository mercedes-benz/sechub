== Build

=== About build technology

Leading entry point/technology is always `gradle`. So if you want to build something, please look at the
corresponding gradle tasks.

We use `github-actions` for CI which gives us a quick response at
`github.com`. For automated deployment or S3 storage testing etc. Jenkins can
 be used by defined pipeline scripts.

=== Build stages
Builds stages were introduced because of a problematic build dependency situation when it comes
to Java API generation. Build stages avoid cyclic build dependencies.

`sechub-api-java` uses a code generator which needs an OpenAPI file. But this file
is only available when SecHub server and PDS projects are compiled!

To switch between the stages you have to define system property `sechub.build.stage`.

[TIP]
====
You do not need to define a build stage for "normal" SecHub development. 

Only when you want to develop/build `sechub-pds-tools`, `sechub-systemtest` or the `sechub-api-java` you need to
setup the build stage accordingly.
====

==== Kind of stages
The build has following stages:

- `without-api` (default) +
  The build will build everything, except those gradle projects which require the OpenAPI file or the generated
  and compiled Java API.
  
- `api-necessary`
   The Gradle initialization phase does contain additionally the Gradle projects which rely on an existing OpenAPI definition
   and/or access to build artifacts of `sechub-api-java`. This means the open file definition does already
   exist and may not change in the build.

- `all` +
  Everything is included, no constraints at all.
  
  
The logic is provided inside `BuildStage.groovy` and a snippet inside `settings.gradle`.
In a nutshell: During the Gradle initialization phase the API related projects are only added 
if wanted.

==== Special treatment on IDE imports
Because the API related gradle projects are not initialized per default, the IDE import mechanism
will not automatically import gradle subprojects like `sechub-systemtest`. 

For the gradle eclipse task there is a special treatment added inside `sechub-developertools/build.gradle`:

===== Eclipse 
When you execute `./gradlew eclipse` at command line the eclipse files for those projects will be generated.
As next step import the additionally created projects manually into Eclipse ("Import -> existing projects").

If you are using the Eclipse standard Gradle integration (Eclipse Buildship), the manual import step 
is probably necessary as well.

Another option is to use the https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/egradle-ide[`EGradle`] plugin - it uses also
`./gradlew eclipse` and does the import automatically.


===== IntelliJ
For IntelliJ - similar to the steps for Eclipse - you can use the gradle idea task
`./gradlew idea -Dsechub.build.stage=all`
