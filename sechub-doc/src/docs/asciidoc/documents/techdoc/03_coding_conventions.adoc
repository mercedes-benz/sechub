== Coding conventions

=== Commit messages
We always commit with an issue id inside the headline message means e.g. on command line:

[source,bash]
----
commit -m "Some short summary #${issueNr}"
----

When having details we always add an empty new line after summary and list details, maybe using "-" at
the beginning to have a pretty output in `GitHub`

=== Database

==== Naming in DB
We are using PostgreSQL which does automatically use lower_case names

==== Naming in JPA
We are using upper cased names

=== Java

==== Classes
Defined class names

- `Rest controller` will be called `${name}RestController.java`
- A `service` is something that will be called by controllers  and will be named `${name}Service.java`
- A factory creating a `target` will be called `${target}Factory.java`
- Something implementing an interface will be called `${nameWithAtLeastInterfacePartAtEnd}Impl.java`

===== Subclassing/ Inheritance
Normally sub classes shall add their custom part in front of the name as a prefix:

E.g. Interface `JobRepository` extends `Repository`

===== Adding additional parts without inheritance
An exception are Custom parts

E.g. Interface `JobRepositoryCustom` is a special addon to JobRepository without inheritance

=== Logging

==== General
We try to avoid massive logging but we want to log relevant parts!

==== Audit Logging
We use a service from shared kernel: `AuditLogService`

==== Security Logging
We use a service from shared kernel: `SecurityLogService`

[[sechub-logging-functional]]
==== Functional Logging
We use a dedicated static log field for functional logging.
Normal logging contains `INFO` level. Problems which are just annoying will come up to `WARN` level.
Bigger problems are logged in level `ERROR`.

Technology used is `slf4j`. We always use logging with parameters - to avoid log injections (should be handled
by logging framework automatically) and also to speed up.

_For example:_
----
LOG.info("This is user:{} which is from department:{}",userId,department);
----

==== Debug Logging
As described in <<sechub-logging-functional, functional logging>>, but with log level `DEBUG`.


=== Services
We try to create small spring services, in most cases a
service with annotation `@Service` should have only one public method

So pretty simple and easy to maintain.

The name should provide information what the service does and has to
end with `Service`. 

Some examples: 

- `MailService` 
- `CreateUserService`
- `InformAdminsThatSchedulerJobProcessingHasBeenDisabledService`

==== Special service variants
===== Transaction services
Sometimes it is necessary to divide transactions.
E.g. When a service triggers a message into event bus and we need
to ensure that data is stored in transaction before the message has been sent.

In this case we insist service ends with `TransactionService`.
For an example look into `ProjectTransactionService`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Only add the special transactional parts to the "transactional" service but  
do all other stuff inside "normal" services!
====

=== RestController
Rest controller should not do any business logic by themselves, but delegate
only to a dedicated service which contains the logic and does the execution.


=== Code2Doc
==== Spring values
All spring `@Value` annotations which are necessary for documentation (except adapters, they got
no access to sechub internal parts and are pretty dump) have to be taged
with `@MustBeDocumented` annotation. See <<section-documentation-in-code,documentation in code>>

==== Messaging
The messaging flow must be documented by annotations as well. There are diagramms automatically generated.
See <<section-documentation-messaging-overview,documentation messaging overview>> for further information.

==== Use cases
[[section-coding-convention-usecases]]
The usecases and their steps have to be
documented inside code by using a dedicated
annotation which itself is tagged with an `@UseCaseDefinition` annotation.
See existing examples in sechub code.

TIP: Tag *relevant* entrypoints as dedicated usecase step so
     other developers can easily find them by their IDE (in eclipse
     for example you can use `CTRL + g` to find all references of the
     selected usecase annotation class

The `UseCaseModelAsciiDocGenerator` will automatically
generate asciidoc file `gen_usecases.adoc` which will
contain all the data from the code and linked
adoc files. Also all *REST API documentation* for usecases having a `@UseCaseRestDoc` association will be automatically generated.

See also <<section-documentation-usecases,Usecase documentation>>


==== Tests

In genereal unit tests which are testing a dedicated class *MUST* have same package as tested classes.
So it's easier to find and also possible to use package private fields for mocking etc.

===== Unit tests
====== Fields
We prefer fields to local variables, fields have to be rebuild by an `@Before` method.

====== Junit versions
Our integration tests and most of the "normal" existing unit tests do currently use Junit4 
as testframework and not Junit5. Because having some special Junit4 Rules for integration 
testing, those tests will be still written in Junit 4, but for new "normal" unit tests you 
should prefer to use Junit5.

NOTE: It is planned to migrate existing tests to Junit5 in future, because of some benefits.
      But unfortunately some method signatures have changed (e.g. "Assert.assertEquals(...) 
      - especially for the message string) so this will take some time. 


====== Maintainable tests
*Structure*
For a better maintenance and reading of tests, we insist on comments dividing a 

- *prepare* +
  setup of mocks, creation of objects etc.
- *check preconditions* _(optional)_ +
  if necessary check that precondition is fulfilled before test is started
- *execute* +
  Execute the part / method which shall be tested
- *test*
  

Except when test code is just a one liner this would be ridiculous.. 

*Naming and creation of fields*

We do

- use a before method to create the instance to test, so "fresh" on every test.
- setup mocks general behaviour in before method, special parts inside test methods
- the part to test shall be named like `${name}toTest` - e.g. `analyzerToTest`
- create mocks inside before method - so no side effects
- provide mocks to services by package private methods (easy to inject + test)
- use simple names for normal mockito mocks, use `mocked${name}` inside MockMVC tests
  where we have injected spring mockito objects. 
- test methods do normally not start with `test` because with Junit4 this become absolete and we
  try to avoid duplication (it's clear this is a test method when `@Test` annotation is at 
  method...)


NOTE: Just refer to existing tests when you start a new one.

[source,java,title='Test structure example1']
----

@Rule
public void ExpectedException expected = ExpectedException.none();

@Before
public void before(){
    /* mocks */
    validator = mock(SimpleUIserIdValidator.class);
    mailService  = mock(SimpleMailService.class);
    
    /* setup */ 
    serviceToTest = new MyServiceToTest();
    serviceToTest.valdiator = validator;
    serviceToTest.mailService = mailService;
    
}

@Test
public void mailservice_is_called(){

  /* execute */
  boolean mailSent = serviceToTest.informUser("user1");

  /* test */
  verify(mailService).sendMail("user1");
  assertTrue(mailSent);

}

@Test
public void inform_user_calls_validator_and_throws_validator_exception(){

  /* test */
  expected.expect(IllegalArgumentException.class);
  expected.expectMessage("wrong user");

  /* prepare */
  doThrow(new IllegalArgumentException("wrong user")).when(validator.validate(eq("user1"));

  /* execute */
  serviceToTest.informUser("user1");


}
----
When a precondition check is really necessary we add also `/* check preconditions */` segment:

[source,java,title='Test structure example2']
----
public void testMe(){
  /* prepare */
  .....
  /* check preconditions */
  ...
  /* execute */
  ...
  /* test */
  ...

}
----

====== Naming of mocks and test targets
- Creating a mock field for e.g. a service `UserService` will be named as `userService`.
  We do NOT add something like a `mock` post or prefix!
- The test target field - e.g. `MailService` will be called something like `....ToTest`.
  For example `serviceToTest`

====== Naming of unit tests
"Normal" Junit tests will simply called ${nameOfClassToTest}Test.java
They have no dependency to spring

====== Using json in unit tests versus production code
org.json.JSONxxyz will make problems because test implementation is using
a lightweight variant with other api.

There were some obscure problems with this situation. So inside
the adapter framework the context has got a dedicated json
support which is using only jackson parts
and has a fluent api.

Use only those for communication. It also has an
automated support for deep tracing with product identification

===== Unit tests (with spring context)
Junit needing a running spring boot container will be called ${nameOfClassToTest}SpringBootTest.java
They use `@SpringBootTest` inside and have access to dependency
injection etc.

TIP: Prefer normal junit tests to spring boot tests, as they are much
           faster and often sufficient.

===== Mocked RestController/MVC Tests (with spring context)
Those tests will also be called `${name}MockTest.java` - will e.g. use use Spring annotation `@WebMvcTest`

===== WireMock tests
When we have to use wire mock - e.g. to mock up product servers, we
call them `${name}WireMockTest.java`

===== DB integration tests
Those tests will be called `${name}DBTest.java` - and will use Spring annotation `@DataJpaTest`

TIP: For an example look into `JobRepositoryDBTest`


===== Integration tests
In project `sechub-integrationtest` full integration tests are settled.
The project needs a running server in profile `integrationtest`.
For more details about those tests read the `README.md` file inside
projects root folder.

====== Integration tests using RestAPI
These tests will be called `${name}Scenario${n}IntTest.java`

====== Integration tests using SecHubClient
Some integration tests do need a build SecHub client and execute the client.
These tests will be called `${name}Scenario${n}SecHubClientIntTest.java`

TIP: If these tests are failing, please check you have called `gradlew buildGo` before,
     otherwise no sechub client is available for test...

[[section-coding-convention-event-trace]]
====== Integration tests generating event trace information
We wanted to have an overview about events happening when a usecase is executed and do 
this by special integration tests where event tracing is enabled. At the end of the test
we write JSON files containing event trace information .

We use `${name}EventTraceScenario${n}IntTest.java` as naming convention for those tests.
See also <<section-documentation-usecase-event-overview,Usecase event overview>> for more information.

[[section-coding-convention-restdoc]]
===== RestDOC tests
In project `sechub-doc` there are `RESTDOC tests` settled. Those tests are annotated with
`UseCaseRestDoc` and associated with dedicated <<section-coding-convention-usecases, UseCase>>.
The tests will automatically create REST api documentation by using `Spring REST DOC`.

(See also <<section-tools-spring-restdoc,REST Doc tooling>>.)

The tests *MUST* be settled here because gradle support classpath runtime information only at current project, so to prevent
heavy changeds on build logic, we simply setup those tests inside `sechub-doc` project itself.

TIP: As a side effect it is very much easier for developers to see what parts are rest doc tested at one glance.

====== What is the difference between a MockTest and a RestDocTest?
RestDoc tests are designed to check fields, params and results described in documentations are really as is.
There is no logic testing inside those tests. They are more or less just for documentation. On the other hand
the MockTest pendants are only for logic testing, so also destructive variants and more technical parts are tested here.

====== How can I ensure that I do not forget to describe necesary REST API parts?
Every call to REST API must be described as a part for <<section-coding-convention-usecases, use cases >>. So there is
a usecase annotation used at the restcontroller method which should have a method with an `@Step` result. At the `@Step`
annotation there is a field `needsRestDoc` which is per default set to `false`. For steps doing rest operations and
needs to be documented, just set `needsRestDoc` to `true`. When you have done this you cannot forget to document, because
there is an automated test which fail when you got not RestDoc tests annotated with `@UseCaseRestDoc` for the use case...
It will not break the build, but produce a failing test. There is also an opposite check that you got no `@UseCaseRestDoc`
tests without corrsponding set of steps having `needsRestDoc` enabled.

TIP: You can also find easily restDoc relevant parts by search caller hierarchy of `needsRestDoc` inside your code.
So you get a list of all controller methods having documented API...

====== Naming
We use `${restControllerClassName}RestDocTest.java` as name pattern to find `RestDoc` tests easier.

`restControllerClassname` is just the java class name of the controller were the rest call is made
(normally the `@Step` annotation must have there the `needRestAPI='true'` setup )

TIP: Having always the Controllers and also the necessary `@MockBean` annotations as spring test
     dependency this will reduce the boilerplate code to one location...
