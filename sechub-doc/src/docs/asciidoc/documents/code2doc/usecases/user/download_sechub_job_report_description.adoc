A user wants to download a `{sechub}` report for an executed job 
by its given job UUID.

The report standard format is a human and machine readable JSON format. 
Additionally, there is the option to download the report as HTML file.

Both, the HTML and the JSON file have a reduced view of the scan
results. Code snippets etc. can be found on the real security products.
