A user wants to mark false positives either for a finished job or with project data not necessarily connected to a finished job.

To mark false positives using job data the job must have been executed, finished without failure and job NOT been deleted.
The user will be able to mark former job results by their given id as false positives.

To mark false positives using project data no job must have been run, but it will help identify findings as false positives of course.
The project data are not related to any job information.
