Administrator restarts job the hard way , means  
it is possible to restart a running (not finished) job and destroy all former results.


[NOTE]
====
It is very similar to related use case 
<<section-uc-description-admin_restarts_job_soft,admin restarts job>>, but with difference
that all former product results and also adapter meta data is removed.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
We do NOT allow restarts of former finished jobs because finalization does destroy interim data 
- e.g. uploaded source code etc. - and is no longer restartable. Also we cannot ensure that a 
client has not already downloaded the existing results, so we we keep them as is!

The term "hard" is only because we destroy former meta data and product results! So the restart
is like from "scratch". 
====

The restart will

- first of all write an audit log enry
- be canceled, when job does not exist in scheduler 
- be canceled, when execution already finished
- delete all former product results and also adapter meta data
- check for running batch jobs with {sechub} job UUID. +
  If there are existing batch operations, those will be stopped 
- new scan will be restarted immediately without scheduling, will not try to reuse existing 
  results because such information was formerly deleted
