Administrator restarts job
 
When a `JVM` (or `POD`) crashes with running {sechub} job, the job process execution has been
terminated without resetting the scheduler state.

If this has happened, somebody or a build server who/which is waiting for sechub job
result will wait infinite and without hope of having a status refresh.

So the admin must be able to restart a job. 

[NOTE]
====
The restart will be intransparent for end user
so they will just keep on waiting but get the result as soon as possible.
====

The restart will

- first of all write an audit log enry
- be canceled, when job does not exist in scheduler 
- be canceled, when execution already finished
- check for running batch jobs with {sechub} job UUID. +
  If there are existing batch operations, those will be stopped 
- new scan will be restarted immediately without scheduling, will try to reuse existing 
  results +
  _E.g. when a static code scan job is triggered to a product and
  scan ID is wellknown, no new scan will be started, but state of this scan is refetched 
  by the ID, etc. etc. But exact resilience behaviour depends on adapter implementation_
