== SecHub client
=== In a nutshell
The `{sechub}` client program is an executable binary which can be used from command
line or in a build tool of your choice.

It's very easy to use and you do not have to handle all the REST-API calls by yourself.

NOTE: Currently the client only supports basic authentication, but of course always only over https.

=== Download
Download the binary for your operating system where you want to trigger `{sechub}` scanning.
You will have no dependencies, just place the single binary file to a location inside your path variable.

Direct download link to the latest client release: {webPage}/latest/client-download.html
For documentation, please look at {webPage}[{sechub} web page] .

=== Supported Platforms

The SecHub Client is available for a number of platforms. A platform is a combination of an operating system and a CPU architecture.

In case your platform is not included in the table, you might be able to compile the SecHub Client for your platform. The SecHub Client is written in the Go programming language. Go supports more platforms. For a full list of supported platforms have a look at the Go documentation: https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment[Optional environment variables].

=== Usage

==== Show help
----
sechub -help
----
will print out a simple help of all command line options. At the end you will find a link to the latest config and variable examples.

==== Actions

Following actions are supported:

===== scan

This is the recommended scan action: You only have to make one single client call to trigger a scan and get the report.

The client performs these steps for you:

 1. create a scan job on the {sechub} server
 2. upload necessary data (e.g. zipped sourcefiles for source scans)
 3. approve the job as ready to start
 4. wait until the job is done
 5. download the report file

NOTE: On "red" (critical or high findings) the {sechub} client exits with a non-zero status so your build will break (depends on your build tool).

IMPORTANT: For security reasons always pass your API-token via the environment variable `SECHUB_APITOKEN`.

**Minimum call syntax**

Prerequisite is a configuration file `sechub.json` in current directory. +
See here for details: <<section-client-configuration-file,Configuration file>>
----
sechub scan
----

TIP: If you prefer the report in HTML format: +
     `sechub -reportformat html scan`

TIP: With `-output ${file-or-directory}` you can define where to place the report. +
     Can be a directory, a file name or a file path. +
     Default: `sechub_report_${your-project}_${jobUUID}.{json|html|spdx}` in current directory

===== scanAsync

Does scan asynchronous:

- Identical to action `scan` but does not wait until the job has finished on the {sechub} server
- Returns the `{sechub}` job UUID of the newly created scan job.

TIP: This can be interesting if you have long running scans and you want have a fast
     continous integration build - but then you have to manually check the
     job state, fetch reports and you get no automated build break!

**Minimum call syntax**
----
sechub scanAsync
----


===== getStatus
Will fetch the job status and return result as json

**Minimum call syntax**
----
sechub getStatus
----

TIP: Defaults to latest job. +
     You can select the job by providing the wanted job UUID by adding `-jobUUID ${jobUUID}`

===== getReport
Will fetch the report as json. (result will only exist when job is done)

**Minimum call syntax**
----
sechub getReport
----

TIP: Defaults to latest finished job. +
     You can select the job by providing the wanted job UUID by adding `-jobUUID ${jobUUID}`

TIP: With `-output ${file-or-directory}` you can define where to place the report. +
     Can be a directory, a file name or a file path. +
     Default: `sechub_report_${your-project}_${jobUUID}.{json|html|spdx}` in current directory

===== listJobs
Lists the last jobs and their state.

**Minimum call syntax**
----
sechub listJobs
----

TIP: This might be useful for an overview or +
     when you want to see your project's scan job queue or +
     to find out the job UUID of a certain job.


===== getFalsePositives
This will fetch the false positives list of your project as JSON - format is same as for `markFalsePositives`.

**Minimum call syntax**
----
sechub getFalsePositives
----

TIP: With `-output ${file-or-directory}` you can define where to place the result. +
     Can be a directory, a file name or a file path. +
     Default: `sechub-false-positives-${your-project}.json` in current directory


[[section-client-false-positives-mark]]
===== markFalsePositives
Read your report carefully and figure out which of the findings are "false positives" (FP).
After this, create a json file containing jobUUID and ID of the findings you decided to be a FP.
You should add an optional comment, describing your decision to mark this as FP.
Select this file by the `-file` argument and start action `markFalsePositives`.

**Minimum call syntax**
----
sechub -file ${json-file} markFalsePositives
----

*Example JSON:*

[source, json]
----
include::../../shared/false-positives/false-positives-REST-API-content-example1.json[]
----
<1> api version
<2> type - must be `falsePositiveJobDataList`
<3> job-UUID of the report where the finding was
<4> finding ID of finding in the report, which shall be marked as false positive
<5> Comment (optional) describing the reason why this is a false positive

IMPORTANT: Providing an empty list here does *NOT delete* the already declared false positives! +
           `markFalsePositives` only adds new false positives. +
           An empty `jobData` list has no effect at all. (-> don't do this)

TIP: See also <<interactiveMarkFalsePositives,interactiveMarkFalsePositives>> for an easy way to declare false positives.


[[section-client-false-positives-unmark]]
===== unmarkFalsePositives
Remove formerly defined false positives. +
It works similar to `markFalsePositives`: Just define a JSON file, select the file by the `-file` argument and start
action `unmarkFalsePositives`

**Minimum call syntax**
----
sechub -file ${json-file} unmarkFalsePositives
----

*Example JSON:*

[source, json]
----
include::sechub_client_falsepositive_list_example_unmark.json[]
----

TIP: <<interactiveUnmarkFalsePositives,interactiveMarkFalsePositives>> might be much easier to use

===== interactiveMarkFalsePositives
Instead of creating a json file to mark false positives, you can also do this interactively:
Go to the project directory containing `sechub.json` and a report file from a recent scan and run `sechub interactiveMarkFalsePositives`.

You can select the report file using the `-file` option of the client. Otherwise the project's latest report file in the current directory is automatically selected.

For each finding in the reports file, you are prompted: `"Add this as false positive?"`
Your choices are:

- `y` Yes - Mark as false positive. You are prompted for an optional comment line which can help to understand later why this has been marked.
- `n` No - Do nothing and go to next item.
- `s` Skip following findings - Finish the marking and add the marked items to the false positives list on the {sechub} server.
- `c` Cancel - Quit and upload nothing

TIP: You can download and view your current false positives list with <<getFalsePositives,getFalsePositives>>

See also <<section-client-interactiveMarkFalsePositives-mark,example for interactiveMarkFalsePositives>>

===== interactiveUnmarkFalsePositives
Instead of creating a json file to unmark false positives, you can also do this interactively:
Go to the project directory containing `sechub.json` and run `sechub interactiveUnmarkFalsePositives`

{sechub} client will download the current false posisitves list and interactively ask each entry: `"Do you want to remove this false positive?"`
Your choices are:

- `y` Yes - Unmark this false positive.
- `n` No - Do nothing and go to next item.
- `s` Skip the rest - End the asking here and remove the marked items from the false positives list on the {sechub} server.
- `c` Cancel - Quit and change nothing

See also <<section-client-interactiveMarkFalsePositives-mark,example for interactiveMarkFalsePositives>>

==== Commandline Options

- `-apitoken <string>` +
  The user's api token - mandatory. _Please try to avoid `-apitoken` parameter for security reasons!!_ +
  Use environment variable `SECHUB_APITOKEN` instead! (see: <<Environment variables>>)
- `-configfile <filepath>` +
  Path to `{sechub}` JSON config file. Defaults to `sechub.json` in current directory.
- `-file <filepath>` +
  Defines file to read from for actions `markFalsePositives` or `interactiveMarkFalsePositives` or `unmarkFalsePositives`
- `-help` +
  Shows help and terminates
- `-jobUUID <string>` +

- `-label <label definition>` +
  Define a SecHub label for the scan job. (Example: "key1=value1") Repeat to define multiple labels.
- `-output <path to folder or file>` +
  Where to place reports, false-positive files etc. Can be a directory, a file name or a file path (defaults to current working directory and default file names)
- `-project <string>` +
  Unique project id - mandatory, but can also be defined in config file or via environment variable.
- `-quiet` +
  Quiet mode - Suppress all informative output. Can also be defined via environment variable `SECHUB_QUIET=true`. +
  Only print filenames written to, errors and explicitely requested informations (job-UUID, version, status).
- `-reportformat <format>` +
  Output format for reports. Currently supported: [`json`, `html`, `spdx-json`]. If an unsupported format string is provided, "json" will always be the fallback.
- `-server <url>` +
  Server url of `{sechub}` server to use - e.g. https//example.com:8081. Mandatory, but can also be defined in config file or via environment variable.
- `-stop-on-yellow` +
  A yellow traffic light in the report will result in a non-zero return code.
- `-tempdir <path to folder>` +
  Temporary files will be placed here. (defaults to current working directory)
- `-timeout <seconds>` +
  Timeout for network communication in seconds. (default 120)
- `-user <string>` +
  Username - mandatory, but can also be defined in config file or via environment variable.
- `-version` +
  Shows version info and terminates
- `-wait <seconds>` +
  Maximum wait time in seconds (default 60).
  Will be used for periodic status checks when action=`scan` and for retries of HTTP calls.

==== Environment variables
Additionally to above cmdline options, you can set some values also via environment variables which can be helpful when you have different SecHub environments (like: dev, int, prod)

- `SECHUB_APITOKEN` +
  The SecHub api token for `SECHUB_USERID`. (same as `-apitoken` option)
- `SECHUB_PROJECT` +
  The SecHub project id. (same as `-project` option)
- `SECHUB_QUIET` +
  Quiet mode (`true` or `false` / unset) - Suppress all informative output. (same as `-quiet` option)
- `SECHUB_SERVER` +
  The SecHub server url. (same as `-server` option)
- `SECHUB_TEMP_DIR` +
  Temporary files will be placed here. Make sure that the folder exists and is writeable. (same as `-tempdir` option)
- `SECHUB_TRUSTALL` +
  When set to `true`, then HTTPS certificate checking will be disabled. May be useful when using self-signed certificates. Please try to avoid this setting for security reasons.
- `SECHUB_USERID` +
  The SecHub username. (same as `-user` option)
- `SECHUB_WAITTIME_DEFAULT` +
  Maximum wait time in seconds (default 60). Will be used for automatic status checks etc. when action=`scan`.
- `SECHUB_WHITELIST_ALL` +
  When set to `true` then ignore the default whitelist for source files and add _every_ file. You may want to define <<sechub-config-example-sourcescan,excludes>> in your `sechub.json` file. _!! Handle with care !!_

Settings for debugging/client development:

- `SECHUB_DEBUG` +
  When set to `true` then log as much as possible (but not HTTP request contents)
- `SECHUB_DEBUG_HTTP` +
  When set to `true` then log HTTP request contents.
- `SECHUB_IGNORE_DEFAULT_EXCLUDES` +
  When set to `true` then default exclude folders `+{"**/test/**", "**/.git/**", "**/node_modules/**"}+` will be included for code scan. In this case, you should declare your own <<sechub-config-example-sourcescan,exclude list>> in the config json.
- `SECHUB_INITIAL_WAIT_INTERVAL` +
  Initial wait time (floating point number) until SecHub client polls the first time if the report is ready (`sechub scan`). Meant for local integration tests.
- `SECHUB_KEEP_TEMPFILES` +
  When set to `true` then `sourcecode-<projectID>.zip` files for code scan will not be removed, so you can check, what was uploaded to the `{sechub}` server.


==== Proxy support
The environment variables `http_proxy`, `https_proxy` and `no_proxy` (or the uppercase versions thereof) can be set to use a proxy for accessing the `{sechub}` server.
(`https_proxy` takes precedence over `http_proxy` for https requests.)

Syntax: `[<scheme>://][<username>:<password>@]<proxy host>[:<proxy port>]`

The environment values may be either a complete URL or a "host[:port]", in which case the "http" scheme is assumed.

Examples (Linux/Mac):

`export http_proxy=http://scott:tiger@proxy.example.org:3128`

`export http_proxy=http://localhost:3128` (e.g. when using a local CNTLM proxy)

==== Debugging
For troubleshooting, you can

- set environment variable `SECHUB_DEBUG` to `true` +
  Now you will see in detail what the client does and also the html calls sent to and received from {sechub} server.
- set environment variable `SECHUB_DEBUG_HTTP` to `true` +
  Now you will see the complete HTTP communication including headers. +
  (basic-auth headers (security) and contents of uploads (binary data) are filtered out)
- set environment variable `SECHUB_KEEP_TEMPFILES` to `true` +
  Now `sourcecode-<projectID>.zip` files for code scan or `binaries-<projectID>.tar` will not be removed, so you can check, what was uploaded to the `{sechub}` server.


[[section-client-configuration-file]]

include::../../shared/configuration/sechub_config.adoc[]


==== Code scan: accepted source code files
The client will per default only include "wellknown" source files.
This is done by inspecting the filename ending. The accepted defaults are shown in next table.

NOTE: *All files having file endings not listed here, will be ignored* and not uploaded to {sechub} server.

TIP: But of course you can also define additional source file endings - see <<sechub-config-example-sourcescan,config file example>> .

include::../../gen/client/gen_table_default_zip_allowed_file_patterns.adoc[]


==== Inject variables into configuration files (For advanced users)
All environment variables are available inside your configuration file in Go
template syntax:

`{{ .ENV_VARIABLE_NAME }}`

For example: When you have defined `USED_API_VERSION` with value `1.0`, you can inject it into a json config file like this:

[source,json]
----
include::sechub_config_apiversion_example.json[]
----


=== Examples

The next subsections contain some `{sechub}` configuration examples.
You can use them as templates for your own files.

First: Define your `{SecHub}` environment variables:

[source, bash]
----
export SECHUB_SERVER=https://sechub.example.org
export SECHUB_USERID=alice
export SECHUB_APITOKEN=EXAMPLE4aa82407da7e06bdbEXAMPLE
