== Integrate new SecHub module
[NOTE]
====
In the following the necessary steps to integrate a new module in the SecHub project are described.
SecHub uses Gradle and the Gradle wrapper.
====

. Create new SecHub module
+
Create your project structure like this: sechub/<your module name>/src/main/java/com.mercedesbenz.sechub.<your package name>/<your source code> analogue your test are placed in the test directory

. Modify your build.gradle file
+
Copy the build.gradle code from another similar project (e.g. a wrapper module) +
Add your main class to the manifest and modify all project specific variables. +

. Modify dependencies in your build.gradle +
Add the dependencies you need, they are global managed in sechub/gradle/libraries.gradle, you can add new dependencies to the libraries.gradle or use existing dependencies +

. Create a getVersion method if needed +
The getVersion Method needs to be implemented in buildSrc/src/main/groovy/VersionData.groovy +
Then you can use it in your build.gradle eg.: version = versionData.getMyNewProductVersion()

. Implement your build tasks in sechub/gradle/build-versioning.gradle

. Include your task in sechub/settings.gradle

. Test if your task is listed with executing ./gradlew tasks +
You should see your newly created task now +

. Build your module +
Run your task defined in your build.gradle with ./gradlew <my new task>
