|Parameter                   |Type     |Description   
//--------------------------------------------------
|checkmarx.fullscan.always   |boolean  |When 'true' every scan will be done as a full scan and delta scan is not used. 

                                        Use this only where a delta scan is not possible/ always rejected by checkmarx. 
                                        When 'false' or any other value, delta scan feature is used. 
                                        
                                        _If a scan fails because checkmarx has detected too many changes there will be a 
                                        retry with fullscan. If you have permanent problems with delta scanning for a 
                                        project you should set this option to 'true' in your checkmarx executor 
                                        configuration._

==== Summary
. Projects are initially created and reused automatically
. Old scans are *NOT* automatically deleted
. Multi tenancy is currently problematic: Same Team ID is always used
  _(will be changed with https://github.com/mercedes-benz/sechub/issues/58[Issue 58])_

// TODO 2019-10-02, Albert Tregnaghi: change here and text block before when team id handling is improved
IMPORTANT: Fix team ID will change in future to provide grouping of results in
           product(for multi tenancy).


=== {netsparker}

==== What does the adapter do?

include::../shared/adapter/netsparker_adapter_flow.adoc[]


==== What must be done on {netsparker} UI

===== Users
- Users must be manual created at {netsparker} UI
- Users must be added to the {netsparker} team used by {sechub}
- If you want to have multi tenancy you have to define website groups
  (see https://github.com/mercedes-benz/sechub/issues/59 for details)

==== Summary
. Websites are initially created and reused automatically
. Old scans are *NOT* automatically deleted

IMPORTANT: Currently {netsparker} adapter will always use ONE team user (admin) to
           create scans. The current logical structure of {netsparker} permissions
           gives all assigned users access to all scans! Keep this in mind.

=== Nessus

==== What does the adapter do?

include::../shared/adapter/nessus_adapter_flow.adoc[]

==== What must be done on {nessus} UI
- define the {nessus} policy UUID

==== Summary
. At the moment only one {nessus} policy UUID is used
. Every scan has got its own name which starts with sechub job UUID
. Old scans are *NOT* automatically deleted
