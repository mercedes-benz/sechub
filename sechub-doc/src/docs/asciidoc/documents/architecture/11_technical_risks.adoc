== Risks and Technical Debts

=== Domain message system
In <<section-architecture-constraints-domain-communication,domain communication constraints>>
is described that we use a very simple DDD approach by using a simple observer
pattern inside JVMs.

==== Handling of lost messages on a JVM crash /pod crash

This currently not solved. When JVM/Pod crushes, the job is in state running
and will not resurrect.

==== Clustering

===== Handling of domain requests for one member only

At current situation there is no double processing of domain messages inside
`sechub` server clusters because every instance of an `sechub` server sends its
domain requests only inside its JVM.

So we must not care about situations where multiple cluster members would handle
domain requests in a multiple way...

WARNING: If we would switch to a solution like
`KAFKA` this must be considered: Events may (normally) only processed at one
cluster member! This could be a critical task if we change domain messaging.
Normally most of the events shall be processed only at one cluster member.

===== Handling of domain requests for complete cluster
Currently this cannot be done by a domain message. We must provide those
central information inside database. An example: When we got 3 running instances
of {sechub} and we want to inform that scheduling shall no longer processed,
we have to inform every instance. But the reduced domain message system works
only inside one JVM. So we must provide this by our cluster wide shared DB.

=== Prevent lost {sechub} jobs on updates
Jobs are running inside a dedicated JVM. When JVM crashes, the job will not
resurrect and become a "zombie".

To prevent such a situation on a rolling update of {sechub} administrators must
disable scheduler job processing before doing the update.
