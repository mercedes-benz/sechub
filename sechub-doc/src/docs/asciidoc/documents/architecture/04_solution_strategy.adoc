== Solution Strategy
=== About
// see for details: https://docs.arc42.org/section-4/

==== Contents
A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies, that shape the systemâ€™s architecture. These include

    - technology decisions
    - decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system, e.g. usage of an architectural pattern or design pattern
    - decisions on how to achieve key quality goals
    - relevant organizational decisions, e.g. selecting a development process or delegating certain tasks to third parties.

==== Motivation
These decisions form the cornerstones for your architecture. They are the basis for many other detailed decisions or implementation rules.

==== Form

Keep the explanation of these key decisions *short*.

Motivate what you have decided and why you decided that way,
based upon your problem statement, the quality goals and key constraints.

==== Solutions

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Server development shall be easy to maintain and developers shall have experience with the language and frameworks
                                        | All       	                              | Spring Boot, Java        |

                                                                                                                 |
| For corporate continous-integration scans we need a scalable solution which can be clustered
                                        | Cluster installation                        | With SpringBoot and DDD we ensure we can run server components inside Kubernetes

| We must avoid "big ball of mud" in development and also be able to separate server parts to smaller deployments easily in future (when needed)

| We want to have many integration tests which are easy to read, maintain, make fun to write,
  have reduced test code and using server nearly as done in production. +

  It shall be possible to execute the integration tests to
  mocked or even to real products. Changes in server structure or even in code, shall does not enforce changes to tests, but only to test framework implementation.
