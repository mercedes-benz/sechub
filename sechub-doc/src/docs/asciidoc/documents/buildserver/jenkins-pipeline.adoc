=== Jenkins auto deployment

When you want to build and automate deployment of {secHub} by https://jenkins.io/[Jenkins]  you can
use a preconfigured pipeline script.

Your Jenkins server should be at minimum: `Jenkins ver. 2.176.1`.

[NOTE]
====
The described Jenkins auto deployment is now *relying on the GitHub actions build* - see 
https://github.com/mercedes-benz/sechub/tree/develop/.github/workflows[GitHub workflows folder].
Deployment artifacts are available at after gradle workflow has been done. 

In future the artifacts will be automatically available in
github packages so you can use those for your autodeployment process and just use it as a maven
repository. In the meantime you must deploy manually. Why still a jenkins file then? 

- You get informed about new available releases. 
- Also the jenkins will check additionally for problems 
- You can do a checksum test for outputs - if you want to check sechub build is not corrupted and
  every version can be rebuild at any time

====

==== Continous integration build

This setup builds all branches except `master` (master is always build by next
job...). The multibranch pipeline build is for continous integration
builds - means to get fast feedback.


*Please setup CI by...*

- Jenkins > create new Item -> `Multibranch pipeline`, name: `sechub-open-source-ci` +
- Branch sources: `Git`+
  * Project repository: `https://github.com/mercedes-benz/sechub.git` +
  * Behaviours:
    . Discover branches
    . Filter by name (with wildcards):
----
      Include: *
      Exclude: master
----
- Build configuration: +
  * Mode `by jenkinsfile`
  * Script path: `continous-integration-multibranch-pipeline.jenkins`
- Scan Multibranch Pipeline Triggers +
  * Periodically if not otherwise run
  * Interval `5 minutes`
- Save ...

==== Release build

Release builds are only done at `master` branch and do also publish
artifacts to maven repository when commit has been tagged.
The tags are starting with a `v` then be followed
by `major`.`minor`.`hotfix`, a hyphen and then the `type`. +
 +
A server could be released by a tag like
`v1.1.0-server`, a new client by `v1.2.0-client` for example.



*For setup release build please do following:*

- Jenkins > create new Item -> `Pipeline`, name: `sechub-open-source-release` +
- Build triggers : `Poll SCM` +
  Schedule:
----
  # every five minutes
  H/5 * * * *
----

- Pipeline: `Pipeline script from SCM` +
  * SCM: Git
    * Repository URL: `https://github.com/mercedes-benz/sechub.git`
    * Branches to build: `*/master`
  * Script Path: `release-pipeline.jenkins`

- Save ...


WARNING: Don't use accidently a *multibranch pipeline* here but only
         a *pipeline* job!
         Otherwise the algorithm for automatical calling for
         `sechub-serer-released` and `sechub-client-released` jobs
         does not work. Reason: multibranch pipelines handle tags special
         and will not fetch tags - what is necessary for release.

==== Special client and server release trigger jobs
If there are new versions of client or server available - means tagged with
client or server versions  (e.g. `v1.1.0-server` or `v1.2.0-client`)  the former
created release job will automatically publish client and server artifacts (includes
documentation, spring boot jars, binaries etc.) to dedicated maven repository
and after this calls one/or two of the following jobs:

`sechub-server-released` with parameter `SERVERVERSION` as `1.1.0` +
`sechub-client-released` with parameter `CLIENTVERSION` as `1.2.0`

So you have to add these additional `Pipeline` jobs.

IMPORTANT: The client and server release jobs has to be stored in *another git repository*
containing your specific deployment parts etc.

===== Examples
Here are some simple examples - easy to adopt:

[source,groovy,title='Example for a `sechub-server-released` job']
----
include::example-sechub-server-released-pipeline.jenkins[]
----

[source,groovy,title='Example for a `sechub-client-released` job']
----
include::example-sechub-client-released-pipeline.jenkins[]
