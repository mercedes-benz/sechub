# About this folder
It will be used for exclude mechanism working on sechub client uploading.
`sechub-integrationtest-client-sourcescan-exluded_some_files.json`
does simple exclude this `README.md` and all `exclude-me.txt` files

## Where is this file used?
See `SecHubExecutionScenarioSecHubClientIntTest.java` and also `sechub-integrationtest-client-sourcescan-excluded_some_files.json`

## Warning
Please do not change the content of this folder and subfolders because the exclude
check is done by creating a checksum which is calculated without the excluded files.
So changing content of included parts will fail test! If you must change the files be aware
to create a windows and a Linux checksum. Why? Because zip files generated for windows are always
a little different than on Linux - even when same content. Maybe paths or a hidden OS stamp...
In order to prevent build and test problems we provide 2 dedicated sha256 keys: one for Windows another for Linux.
