# At the end let us check the "recompressed" folder. Reason: We use a mocked adapter here.
# The mocked adapters do only check the folder paths inside the adapter configuration and just
# return a mock result depending on the found path.
#   
# "Normal" PDS integration tests do not use a mocked adapter, but here we have a real PDS adapter
# in use which calls a script (this one) which uses a wrapper, which uses a mocked adapter (checkmarx)
# to simulate server calling...
#
# To check the re-compression works as expected, we can inspect the recompressed parts here after
# the normal checkmarx.sh script has been called.
