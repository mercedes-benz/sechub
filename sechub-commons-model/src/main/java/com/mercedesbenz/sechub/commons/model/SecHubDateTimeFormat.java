 * Inside SecHub we want an explicit date time format which is stable, defined

 * aware about this situation, but after a while this lead to failures/problems,
 * which we want to avoid.
 *
 * This is the reason why we define an explicit format here. We use UTC as time
 * zone and use a ISO 8601 pattern to keep it human readable.
 *
 * The serialization ({@link LocalDateTimeSserializer}) and the deserialization
 * ({@link SecHubLocalDateTimeDeserializer}) are able to handle this pattern.
