= PDS-Solutions

It is easy to integrate security products, even command line tools, into 
`SecHub` via `PDS` (Product delegation server).

A PDS solution is a ready-made package for SecHub in which a PDS and the necessary security
products are already pre-installed and can be used directly without additional adjustments.

Every solution works "out-of-the-box" and can be started as

- Docker container (single instance)
- Docker compose (cluster) or 
- Kubernetes deployment via Helm chart

[TIP]
====
**Look** into the sub folders for the `PDS-Solutions`. +
Every folder contains a `README.adoc` file which describes the solution in detail.
