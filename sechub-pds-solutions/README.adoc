= PDS-Solutions

It is easy to integrate security products, even command line tools without a network API, into 
`SecHub` via `PDS` (Product delegation server).

A PDS solution is a ready-made package for SecHub in which a PDS and the necessary security
products are already pre-installed and can be used directly without additional adjustments.

Every solution works "out-of-the-box" and can be started as

- Docker container (single instance)
- Docker compose (cluster) or 
- Kubernetes deployment

[TIP]
====
Look into the sub folders for the `PDS-Solutions` - every folder contains a  `README.adoc` file
which describes the solution in detail.

For more technical information please look at the https://mercedes-benz.github.io/sechub/[online documentation].
