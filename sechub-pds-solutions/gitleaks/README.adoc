= Gitleaks + PDS

https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks[Gitleaks] is a free and open source secret scanner tool. Gitleaks is a command line interface (CLI) tool. By combining Gitleaks  with the SecHub https://mercedes-benz.github.io/sechub/latest/sechub-product-delegation-server.html[Product Delegation Server (PDS)] in a container, Gitleaks can be used with SecHub. Another scenario is to use Gitleaks+PDS standalone.

Furthermore, the combination of Gitleaks and PDS makes it possible to run both inside a Kubernetes cluser or virtual machines.

This folder contains the necessary scripts to run Gitleaks+PDS inside a container locally.

== Run Locally

This is the easiest way to get started.

=== Requirements

Docker and Docker-Compose need to be installed:

. https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Install Docker]

. Linux: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user[Use Docker as non Root user]

. https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Install Docker-Compose]

=== Single Instance

Start a single instance by using the Bash wrapper script which does setup everything automatically for you.

==== Scan script

The folder contains a start script which does the manual steps for you:

----
./01-start-docker-compose.sh
----

==== Together with SecHub

The container will be started and attached to the `sechub` Network.

WARNING: Make sure the SecHub container is running.

. Start container:
+
----
./05-start-single-sechub-network-docker-compose.sh
----

=== Scan

The scan script scans using the Gitleaks+PDS solution directly.

. Set the environment variables
+
----
export PDS_SERVER=https://<pds-host>:<port>
export PDS_USERID=admin
export PDS_APITOKEN="<pds-admin-apitoken>"
export PDS_PRODUCT_IDENTFIER=PDS_GITLEAKS
----
+
For example:
+
----
export PDS_SERVER=https://localhost:8444
export PDS_USERID=admin
export PDS_APITOKEN="pds-apitoken"
export PDS_PRODUCT_IDENTFIER=PDS_GITLEAKS
----
+
[NOTE]
Those values are the default values from `env-initial` and `env-cluster-initial` files. In case you run Gitleaks+PDS in Kubernetes or other environments those values will be different.

. Scan by providing a `ZIP` folder with source code containing secrets.
+
----
cd sechub/sechub-solutions-shared/scripts
./01-test.sh <path-to-zip-file>
----
+
For example:
+
----
cd sechub/sechub-solutions-shared/scripts
./01-test.sh ~/myproject.zip
----

=== Change the Configuration

There are several configuration options available for the Gitleaks+PDS `docker-compose` files. Have a look at `.env` and `.env-single` for more details.

=== Troubleshooting

This section contains information about how to troubleshoot Gitleaks+PDS if something goes wrong.

==== Access the container

----
docker exec -it pds-gitleaks bash
----

==== Java Application Remote Debugging of PDS

. Set `JAVA_ENABLE_DEBUG=true` in the `.env` file

. Connect via remote debugging to the `pds`
+
connect via CLI
+
----
jdb -attach localhost:15024
----
+

+
or connect via IDE (e. g. Eclipse IDE, VSCodium, Eclipse Theia, IntelliJ etc.).

== Build Image and Push to Registry

Build container images and push them to registry to run Gitleaks+PDS on virtual machines, Kubernetes or any other distributed system.

=== Build Image

Build the container image.

==== Build

. Using the default image:
+
----
./10-create-image.sh my.registry.example.org/sechub/pds_gitleaks v0.1
----

. Using your own base image:
+
----
./10-create-image.sh my.registry.example.org/sechub/pds_gitleaks v0.1 "my.registry.example.org/pds-base"
----

=== Push Image to Registry

Push the container image to a registry.

* Push the version tag only
+
----
./20-push-image.sh my.registry.example.org/sechub/pds_gitleaks v0.1
----

* Push the version and `latest` tags
+
----
./20-push-image.sh my.registry.example.org/sechub/pds_gitleaks v0.1 yes
----
