= Xray Wrapper + PDS

JFrog Xray is a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) solution integrated with the JFrog Artifactory. Xray can analyze source code, binaries, etc. for vulnerabilities and licenses.
In addition, the combination of Xray and PDS allows both to run in a Kubernetes cluster or on virtual machines.
To use the wrapper, a JFrog artifactory instance and the URL and register name is required.

This folder contains the scripts necessary to run Xray Wrapper + PDS locally within a container. It also contains scripts to create the PDS + Xray container and push it to your container registry, as well as a helmet diagram to install and run Xray Wrapper + PDS in a Kubernetes cluster.

== Current restrictions

- only docker images uploaded as .tar files can be scanned

== Run Locally

This is the easiest way to get started.

=== Requirements

Docker and Docker-Compose need to be installed:

. https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Install Docker]

. Linux: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user[Use Docker as non Root user]

. https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Install Docker-Compose]

=== Single Instance

Start a single instance by using the Bash wrapper script which does setup everything automatically for you.

==== Scan script

The folder contains a start script which does the manual steps for you:

----
./01-start-single-docker-compose.sh
----

==== Together with SecHub

The container will be started and attached to the `sechub` Network.

WARNING: Make sure the SecHub container is running.

. Start container:
+
----
./05-start-single-sechub-network-docker-compose.sh
----
+
example sechub.json +
+
[source,json]
