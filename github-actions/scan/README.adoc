You can access them after the action has run with `${{ steps.<step-id>.outputs.<output-name> }}`

=== Build

To build the action locally you have to run this command:

[source,npm]
----
npm run build
----

This will run the `ncc` compiler and transpile the files from the src folder into the files from the dist folder.
The dist files will be executed by the GitHub Action.

It's necessary to execute the build after every change of the sources and you have to commit the changes in dist to git.

=== Test

To run the tests you have to run this command:

[source,npm]
----
npm run test
----
