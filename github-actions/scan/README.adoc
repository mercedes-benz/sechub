== GitHub Action for SecHub scan

This GitHub action uses the SecHub cli to scan the repository for security issues.


=== Usage

To be able to use this action you need a SecHub project. Check the https://mercedes-benz.github.io/sechub/[documentation] on how to set one up.

    config-path: 'sechub.json'

    # OPTIONAL: SecHub server url
    url: ${{ secrets.SECHUB_SERVER }}

    # OPTIONAL: SecHub api token
    api-token: ${{ secrets.SECHUB_APITOKEN }}

    # OPTIONAL: SecHub user
    user: ${{ secrets.SECHUB_USERID }}

```

=== Build

To build the action locally you have to run this command:

[source,npm]
----
npm run build
----

This will run the `ncc` compiler and transpile the files from the src folder into the files from the dist folder.
The dist files will be executed by the GitHub Action.

It's necessary to execute the build after every change of the sources and you have to commit the changes in dist to git.

=== Test

To run the tests you have to run this command:

[source,npm]
----
npm run test
----
