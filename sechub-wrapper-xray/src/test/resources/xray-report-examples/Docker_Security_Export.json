One of the utilities that can be provided with libtiff is tiffcrop, which is most often used to extract portions of an image for processing.\r\n\r\n`tiffcrop` can be run with one or more flags. These flags include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n* `-Z`: With the `-Z` flag, the user can specify zones of the image designated as position X of Y equal sized portions measured from the reference edge, multiple zones can be specified as a comma separated list but they must reference the same edge.\r\n* `-e`: With the `-e` flag, the user can specify the export mode for images and selections from input images.\r\n\r\nWhen running `tiffcrop` with the `-e` flag set to `divided`, `multiple` or `separate` and also with the `-Z` flag (unless only one zone is specified with the -Z flag), an attacker can provide a crafted TIFF file which will cause a heap overflow in the `processCropSelections()` function.\r\n\r\nAlthough the heap overflow could potentially lead to RCE, no exploit or technical writeup suggested such an impact for this issue.",

            "ShortDescription": "(Non-issue) Integer truncation in Kerberos5 leads to no impact when processing a crafted Kerberos5 beta7 format database file.",
            "FullDescription": "[Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/) is a network authentication protocol. It is designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography. A free implementation of this protocol is available from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Kerberos is available in many commercial products as well.\r\n\r\nA [Kerberos database](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/admin/database.html) contains all of a realm’s Kerberos principals, their passwords, and other administrative information about each principal. For the most part, you will use the `kdb5_util` program to manipulate the Kerberos database as a whole, and the `kadmin` program to make changes to the entries in the database. \r\n\r\nIn `kdb5_util`, there is a `process_k5beta7_princ` method responsible for adding Kerberos 5 beta 7 format data from a file to the Kerberos database. This function is vulnerable to integer overflow as a Database entry defined on 16-bits is assigned a 32-bits value from the given file. It turns out that it does not have any impact at all and it is not a security flaw.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the vulnerability was mistakenly reported as an Integer Overflow.\r\nThe issue should not affect any other data allocated close to the 16-bit integer in question. Furthermore, a negative value of the 16-bit integer does not impact the flow of the program in any meaningful way.\r\n\r\nTo trigger the integer truncation, an attacker has to get the user to use the `kdb5_util` utility to restore a Kerberos 5 - beta 7 format - database from a crafted malicious file. It can be done using the following command:\r\n```\r\nkdb5_util load -d DB_NAME DB_FILE \r\n```",

For the most part, you will use the `kdb5_util` program to manipulate the Kerberos database as a whole, and the `kadmin` program to make changes to the entries in the database. \r\n\r\nIn `kdb5_util`, there is a `process_k5beta7_princ` method responsible for adding Kerberos 5 beta 7 format data from a file to the Kerberos database. This function is vulnerable to integer overflow as a Database entry defined on 16-bits is assigned a 32-bits value from the given file. It turns out that it does not have any impact at all and it is not a security flaw.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the vulnerability was mistakenly reported as an Integer Overflow.\r\nThe issue should not affect any other data allocated close to the 16-bit integer in question. Furthermore, a negative value of the 16-bit integer does not impact the flow of the program in any meaningful way.\r\n\r\nTo trigger the integer truncation, an attacker has to get the user to use the `kdb5_util` utility to restore a Kerberos 5 - beta 7 format - database from a crafted malicious file.

For the most part, you will use the `kdb5_util` program to manipulate the Kerberos database as a whole, and the `kadmin` program to make changes to the entries in the database. \r\n\r\nIn `kdb5_util`, there is a `process_k5beta7_princ` method responsible for adding Kerberos 5 beta 7 format data from a file to the Kerberos database. This function is vulnerable to integer overflow as a Database entry defined on 16-bits is assigned a 32-bits value from the given file. It turns out that it does not have any impact at all and it is not a security flaw.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the vulnerability was mistakenly reported as an Integer Overflow.\r\nThe issue should not affect any other data allocated close to the 16-bit integer in question. Furthermore, a negative value of the 16-bit integer does not impact the flow of the program in any meaningful way.\r\n\r\nTo trigger the integer truncation, an attacker has to get the user to use the `kdb5_util` utility to restore a Kerberos 5 - beta 7 format - database from a crafted malicious file.

            "FullDescription": "[ncurses](https://invisible-mirror.net/archives/ncurses/) (new curses) is a programming library providing an application programming interface (API) that allows the programmer to write text-based user interfaces (TUI) in a terminal-independent manner. It is a toolkit for developing \"GUI-like\" application software that runs under a terminal emulator.\r\n\r\nThe `captoinfo` tool, which is a symbolic link of the `tic` tool but runs with the `-I` option, converts a` termcap` source file to a `terminfo` source file and displays it on the screen. A bug in `termcap` source file parsing could cause a buffer overread that leads to segmentation fault. Originally, the CVE was mistakenly reported as a heap buffer overflow.\r\nTo exploit this issue, the attacker must find an input that propagates to the `captoinfo` utility of the `ncurses` library to exploit this vulnerability.",

            "FullDescription": "[ncurses](https://invisible-mirror.net/archives/ncurses/) (new curses) is a programming library providing an application programming interface (API) that allows the programmer to write text-based user interfaces (TUI) in a terminal-independent manner. It is a toolkit for developing \"GUI-like\" application software that runs under a terminal emulator.\r\n\r\nThe `captoinfo` tool, which is a symbolic link of the `tic` tool but runs with the `-I` option, converts a` termcap` source file to a `terminfo` source file and displays it on the screen. A bug in `termcap` source file parsing could cause a buffer overread that leads to segmentation fault. Originally, the CVE was mistakenly reported as a heap buffer overflow.\r\nTo exploit this issue, the attacker must find an input that propagates to the `captoinfo` utility of the `ncurses` library to exploit this vulnerability.",
